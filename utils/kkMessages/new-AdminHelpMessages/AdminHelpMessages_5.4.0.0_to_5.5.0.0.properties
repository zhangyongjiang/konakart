help.catalogs             = The Enterprise version of KonaKart allows you to define multiple catalogs for a single store. Each catalog contains the same products, but they may have different prices and quantity in stock. There are separate database tables that store the prices and quantities for each catalog.<br/><br/>This panel allows you to define a new catalog. The catalog name is used as the one of the keys in the tables that store prices and quantities. The description is only used in this panel to describe the catalog in case you decide to make the name non descriptive. The checkboxes allow you to choose whether the catalog should store prices
help.editProductsBookable = When a product is of type <b>Bookable Product</b>,  this folder becomes visible to allow you to specify attributes that are only applicable to a bookable product. <br /><br />A bookable product such as a course, has a start and end date. These dates can be set to the same day, but the end date must not precede the start date. Once the dates have been set, you may define time slots. A time slot defines a start and end time for a day within the start and end dates. The times must follow the 24 hour notation where 2:15 AM is 2:15 and 2:15 PM is 14:15. A day may have more than one time slot. i.e. A course may have a few hours in the morning, a break for lunch and a few hours in the afternoon. The drop list that allows you to select a day, will only display valid days that exist between the start and end dates.<br /><br />A bookable product may have bookings associated with it (i.e. students that have signed up for a course). There is an attribute that defines the maximum number of bookings that can be made for this product (-1 for no limit) and one for the current number of bookings that have been made. The current number is updated automatically every time a booking is made through the application or admin application APIs. .<br /><br />Finally there are 5 custom fields that may be used to add information specific to the type of bookable product being defined.
