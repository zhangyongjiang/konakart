help.importerConfig   = <b>Importer Configuration</b><br /><br />Configuration settings for Importer Jobs<br /><br />As with other Configuration Settings, you can modify these values and refresh the caches (see under the <b>Tools</b> menu) to see them have an instant effect (although some that affect the Admin App require you to log out then log in again).<br /><br />There are 3 Custom Import buttons that can be configured to execute import operations (see the Importer Panel).  If these require configuration settings then this panel would be a good place to put them.
help.enterpriseOnly   = <b>Enterprise Only</b><br /><br />This panel is only available in the Enterprise verison of KonaKart.<br /><br />Please contact <a href="mailto:sales@konakart.com?Subject=KonaKart%20 Enterprise%20Edition">sales@konakart.com</a> for information about the Enterprise version.
help.importer         = <b>KonaKart Importer</b><br /><br />This panel allows you to import data from files into KonaKart using custom import routines.  Please refer to the User Guide for more details.<br /><br />For the <b>Import</b> and <b>Delete</b> commands you first need to select one or more files to operate on before clicking on the respective buttons.<br /><br />By default, the <b>Import</b> button is configured to load products into KonaKart from the selected file.  An example datafile (productsExample.xml) is provided which is an example of the format of the file that is required for this simplified import routine. <br /><br />You can upload new data files for subsequent import by clicking on the <b>Upload</b> button.<br /><br />The <b>Refresh</b> button updates the set of files in the directory specified to hold the data files.   You can configure the location of the data files directory on the panel at <b>Configuration >> Importer Configuration</b>.  Likewise you can configure where the importer log files will be written on the same configuration panel.
help.resetDatabase    = <b>Reset Database</b><br /><br /><b>PROCEED WITH CAUTION</b><br /><br />On clicking the <b>Delete</b> button the database will be emptied of all of the following records:<br /><ul><li>Products</li><li>Categories</li><li>Product Options</li><li>Bookings</li><li>Orders</li><li>Miscellaneous Items</li><li>Subscriptions</li><li>WishLists</li><li>Expressions</li><li>Custom Attributes and Custom Attribute Templates</li><li>Promotions</li><li>Audit Data</li></ul><br />This is a way to empty the database when you want to remove all the sample data that is provided in the default KonaKart installation.<br /><br />Note that Customers are not removed and neither are the reference records such as Currencies, Languages and Tax-related objects.<br /><br />Following a successful execution of this command the database will be ready to add your own data without any sample data remaining.<br /><br />Clearly this is a powerful operation so <b>should only be used if you are certain you want to empty your database</b>.  Note that there is no undo operation to get the deleted data back.
help.sitemap          = <b>Sitemap Configuration</b><br /><br />These are the configuration parameters for the Sitemap generation in your store. <br /><br />You can define the directory where the sitemap files will be written. They are generated by a batch job which can be scheduled to run at regular intervals by the Quartz scheduler. It can also be run interactively from the Admin App under <b>Scheduler >> Scheduler</b>.
help.viewImporterLogs = <b>View Importer Logs</b><br /><br />This panel allows you to view the log files in your defined importer log files directory<br /><br />Select a log file then click the "<b>View</b>" button to display it.<br /><br />To delete a log file, first select it, then click the "<b>Delete</b>" button to delete it.  You are asked to confirm the deletion before the log file is actually deleted.<br /><br />To refresh the list of log files from the directory click the "<b>Refresh</b>" button.
