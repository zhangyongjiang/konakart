help.prodAttrs         = Custom attributes are attributes which you may define and then add to a template which in turn may be added to a product. This panel allows you to create new and manage existing attributes. Each custom attribute definition has the following attributes:<ul><li><b>Name:</b> The name of the custom attribute which is a compulsory field. i.e. ScreenSize or MegaPixels etc.</li><li><b>Type:</b> You may choose types from a drop list. This information may be used by the storefront application when displaying the attribute value. i.e. If it knows the type of attribute it may decide what template to use in order to display it.</li><li><b>Set Function:</b> This is used by the admin app when creating a UI widget for the custom attribute. Valid Set Functions are:<ul><li>integer(min,max) where min and max may be numbers or set to null. i.e. integer(10,null) checks that the integer has a minimum value of 10 or above. Integer(null,null) just checks that the value entered is an integer without doing any range checking.</li><li>double(min,max) using the same logic as explained above for decimal numbers.</li><li>string(min,max) using the same logic as explained above for the length of the string.</li><li>choice('true','false')creates a radio button panel with the options of true and false. choice('msg.small','msg.medium','msg.large') creates 3 radio buttons where the labels are looked up in a message catalog. In this case, the text displayed is looked up from the message catalog, whereas the values saved are always msg.small, msg.medium and msg.large regardless of the language.</li><li>option(0=date.day.long.Sunday,1=date.day.long.Monday,2=date.day.long.Tuesday) creates a drop list for the first 3 days of the week. The text of the days displayed is retrieved from the message catalog whereas the saved data is 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday etc. </li></ul></li><li><b>Template:</b> The template contains a string that may be used by the storefront application to display the value. i.e. In the case of a date, the storefront application could detect that it is a date from the <b>type</b> and then use the template to display the date correctly. </li><li><b>Msg Cat Key:</b> This is used by the storefront and admin applications to look up the label from the message catalog. If not present, the <b>name</b> may be used.</li><li><b>Validation:</b> This may contain regular expression such as true|false or [0-9]* which will be used by the admin app to validate the attribute.</li><li><b>Custom Fields:</b> The custom fields may contain any metadata for the attribute which can be used by the storefront application. i.e. A custom field may contain data useful for grouping custom attributes.</li></ul>
help.prodAttrTemplates = Product attribute templates are used to group custom product attributes so that they may be assigned to a product. There is only one compulsory attribute which is the template name that must be unique. The description and custom attributes may be used to add further information. <br/><br/>Once a template has been created, in order to be used, it should be linked to one or more custom attributes by clicking the <b>Attributes</b> button at the bottom of the panel. This button opens a pop-up panel which allows you to search for custom attributes and then to add these to the template. The order in which they are added is important because it is the same ordering used to store and retrieve the custom data for a product.
