help.dataFeeds        = <b>Data Feeds</b><br /><br />This section is for configuring your data feeds.   Currently you can only send your product details to Google Data, but other feeds may be added in the future. <br /><br />To enable you to send your products to Google you must first obtain a Google account and a Google API key and enter the details below.<br /><br />To run the product feed update either choose the option on the Tools menu of the Admin App or check the KonaKart User Guide for instructions on how to run the product feed update from a job scheduler such as cron.<br /><br />If you disable Google Data Feeds here, no data (inserts, updates or deletes) will be sent to Google Base when you modify (insert, update or delete) products in KonaKart. Conversely, if you enable Google Data Feeds, KonaKart will update the published data in Google when product data is changed within KonaKart, using the credentials you define on this configuration panel.
help.editStore        = This panel allows you to edit an existing store.<br /><br />Once the storeId is set for a store it cannot be changed but the name and description can be changed at any time.<br /><br />The store status settings are defined as follows:<br /><br /><b>Enabled</b> = active stores that are available for use.  If disabled a store is not accessible to application or admin app users. <br /><br /><b>Under Maintenance</b> = stores that are currently being maintained so are inaccessible to application users
help.insertStore      = This panel allows you to insert a new store.<br /><br />You specify the storeId here but you cannot change this after your save the store the first time.  The storeId you choose must be unique - the system will not let you insert a new store with a storeId that's already being used.<br /><br />The name and description can be changed at any time.<br /><br />The store status settings are defined as follows:<br /><br /><b>Enabled</b> = active stores that are available for use.  If disabled a store is not accessible to application or admin app users. <br /><br /><b>Under Maintenance</b> = stores that are currently being maintained so are inaccessible to application users
help.multistoreConfig = <b>Multi-Store Configuration</b><br /><br />These are the configuration variables that are used in a multi-store installation.<br /><br />You can define the multi-store template storeId to the store whose reports you wish to copy for new stores (in the future, more configuration data may be copied from the template store).<br /><br />You can define the roles that will be assigned to new users that are created when you create new stores.  The number of new users that are created when creating new stores is dependent on whether you are using Shared or Non-Shared Customers.  In Shared Customers mode, only a "Store Administrator" user is created
help.publishProducts  = Click the <b>Publish</b> button to start a background process that will publish details of all your visible and active products to Google.<br /><br />This process uses the values configured on the <b>Data Feeds</b> Configuration panel.<br /><br />Check your publish products log in your logs directory and the container log for details of the success or failure of the publishing process.
help.solrControl      = You can use this panel to add all products in the catalog to the Solr search engine and to remove all products indexed by the Solr search engine.<br /><br />Solr should already be running and be available at the URL which can be configured under <b>Configuration>>Solr Search Engine</b>.<br /><br />Since the add / remove requests could take some time to complete, the processes run asynchronously and control is immediately restored to the Admin App. In order to track progress, you may use the Solr Admin App which will show many statistics of the Solr Server. If for some reason an exception occurs, you will be able to read details in the Solr log.
help.stores           = <b>Store Maintenance</b><br /><br />If you have been granted sufficient privileges, you may search for a store in the mall by entering any combination of the search criteria at the top of the panel then clicking the Search button.<br /><br />The search is not case sensitive unless your database is configured to be non-case sensitive.  Wildcard configuration parameters control the precise searches of substrings (See <b>Configuration>>Admin App Configuration</b>) but with the default settings a wildcard is added before and after all search text which means that, for example, storeId <b>StoreX</b> will be returned if you enter <b>tor</b> as the StoreId.<br /><br />In a similar fashion you can search for a store in the mall on whether or not it is enabled or disabled, under maintenance or not under maintenance and whether or not it is marked as deleted.<br /><br />Only the stores you are authorized to maintain will be returned.<br /><br />Any displayed stores may be edited or deleted by clicking the respective buttons at the bottom of the list assuming the relevant privileges have been granted to the current user.<br /><br />The user must have edit store privileges for the Edit Store panel in order for the Edit button to be visible.<br /><br />To create a new store click the <b>New</b> button whereupon a new panel will be displayed on which you define the attributes for the new store.<br /><br /><b>Enabled</b> = active stores that are available for use.  If disabled a store is not accessible to application or admin app users. <br /><br /><b>Under Maintenance</b> = stores that are currently being maintained so are inaccessible to application users
