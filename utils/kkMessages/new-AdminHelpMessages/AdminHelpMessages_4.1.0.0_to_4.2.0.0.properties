help.customerTags        = This panel is used to create, edit and delete customer tags. A customer tag can be associated with a customer and given a value for that customer. The tags are used for marketing purposes, to show dynamic content, to determine whether to activate a promotion and to filter the recipients of customer mailings. Expressions can be created using the tags, that can be evaluated in real time to display dynamic content. i.e. Show a banner or activate a promotion only to customers over 50 years old that have viewed products in a particular category. <br/><br/> The <b>tag type</b> can take the following values:<ul><li>STRING_TYPE - The tag value is in the format of a String. i.e. To store the country from which the store is being accessed.</li><li>INT_TYPE - The tag type is in the format of an int. i.e. To save the product id of  the last product viewed by the customer. </li><li>MULTI_INT_TYPE - The tag type allows the tag to store an array of ints. When this type is selected, the <b>Max Number of Ints</b> attribute determines the maximum number of ints in the array. i.e. To store the ids of the last 5 products viewed by the customer.</li><li>DECIMAL_TYPE - The tag type is in the format of a decimal. i.e. To store the value of all items in the basket.</li><li>DATE_TYPE - The tag type is in the format of a date. i.e. To store the date of the last login for the customer.</li><li>BOOLEAN_TYPE - The tag type is in the format of a boolean. i.e. To store the customer gender. The tag could be named IS_MALE and take values of true or false.</li></ul>The <b>name</b> of the tag is important because it will be used to identify the tag when being set for a customer. The <b>description</b> of the tag is used in the expression builder when building an expression using the tag. i.e. A tag may be named LAST_PRODUCT_VIEWED and have a description, "last product viewed".<br/><br/>The <b>validation</b> attribute is optional and may contain regular expression to validate values entered in the expression builder. i.e. For a boolean tag it should be set to true|false.<br/><br/>The custom fields can be used to store custom data for the tag. The labels for the custom fields can be changed in the message catalog.
help.editCustomerTags    = This folder is used to view, edit, insert and remove customer tag values for a customer. The tags are used for marketing purposes, to show dynamic content, to determine whether to activate a promotion and to filter the recipients of customer mailings. Expressions can be created using the tags, that can be evaluated in real time to display dynamic content. i.e. Show a banner or activate a promotion only to customers over 50 years old that have viewed products in a particular category. <br/><br/>Normally, the value of a tag is set automatically as a customer uses the store front application. For example, a tag may be set to store the search string as a customer searches for a product, or to store the current basket total, or to store the id of a product or category that the customer is viewing. This folder allows you to view the current tag values for a customer and in rare circumstances, modify them.<br/><br/>All of the defined customer tags are listed in the list box on the left hand side. The tags that have a value for this customer are listed in the panel on the right hand side. In order to add one or more tags, they must be selected and then added by clicking the <b>>></b> button. A value has to be entered for the tag before saving. If the <b>Validation</b> attribute of the selected tag, contains regular expression, then the value is validated against this regular expression. Internally the tag value is always stored as a string, although each tag has a type and utility methods for getting and setting the value as a date, integer, decimal, boolean and integer array. Therefore don't be alarmed if instead of seeing a date, you see a long number or see a string that looks like :23:1:78: when the tag is of type MULTI_INT. For the case of a date, the float-over text will always tell you what the date actually is.
help.expressions         = Expressions are used to make decisions based on customer behaviour and attributes. For example, we may want to show specific content from visitors from a Google search or apply a promotion to a customer on his birthday, or a promotion for customers that have placed an order in the last month and have viewed the details of a particular product. The combinations are endless !<br/><br/>Expressions are created using customer tags. A customer tag can be associated with a customer and given a value for that customer. An expression can evaluate one or more mathematically connected customer tag values. This is best explained using an example:<br/>Let's say that we want to show a banner to all male customers  over the age of 40 who have viewed the details of a shirt with a product id of 1056. First of all we need to create three customer tags:<ul><li>IS_CUSTOMER_MALE (BOOLEAN_TYPE)</li><li>CUSTOMER_AGE (INT_TYPE)</li><li>RECENTLY_VIEWED_PRODUCT (MULTI_INT_TYPE)</li></ul>For step two, we need to ensure that these tags are populated by the store front application when a customer registers and as he navigates around the application viewing products. The third step is to create an expression that looks like:<br/>IS_CUSTOMER_MALE=TRUE AND CUSTOMER_AGE>40 AND  RECENTLY_VIEWED_PRODUCT=1056<br/>Finally, within the application, the expression has to be evaluated on the page where the banner needs to be shown in order to decide whether or not to display the banner.<br/><br/>The only compulsory attribute of an expression is the expression name which can later be used to search for it. Once an expression has been created in this panel, you can click the <b>Variables</b> button in order to open a new panel where the expression logic can be created as described in the example above.
help.expressionVariables = If no variables exist, you must click the <b>New</b> button which will then display one empty expression variable. From the drop lists you can select the customer tag and operator to use. The value entered, must match the customer tag type. i.e. If the customer tag is BOOLEAN_TYPE, you will only be allowed to enter true or false selected from a drop list. If it is DATE_TYPE, a pop-up calendar will appear to aid you in choosing a date. If your expression consists of only one customer tag, you may click the <b>Save</b> button and you've finished. If you need to AND or OR the values from two tags, then you must click the <b>New</b> button next to the current tag which will create a new expression variable. For a more complicated expression you may want to create (A OR B) AND (B AND C) OR (D AND E OR F) where interim results are grouped together before being evaluated. In order to create a group, you must click the <b>Grp</b> button. This will create and display an AND/OR drop list below the selected variable rather than to the left of it.<br/><br/>The <b>Cancel</b> button will revert all variable data to the values entered during the previous save.
