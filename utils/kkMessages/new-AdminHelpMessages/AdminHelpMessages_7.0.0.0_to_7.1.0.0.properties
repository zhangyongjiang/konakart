help.address.store     = This panel enables you to manage addresses for stores.<br/><br/>Each store may be associated with multiple addresses. Note that the Default Addr check box is disabled because the notion of a primary or default address is not supported for store addresses. If required you can use custom fields to tag the addresses.<br/><br/>The <b>Configuration>>AdminApp Configuration</b> section of the Admin App allows you to define how the address is formatted for display purposes in this panel.
