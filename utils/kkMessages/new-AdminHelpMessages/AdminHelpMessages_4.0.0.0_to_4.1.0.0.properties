help.editProductsStores = This panel can be used to assign products to multiple stores. The price Id may be different for each store so that the product can pick up a different price based on the store.<br /><br />In insert mode, the panel will be empty and during the insert, the product will be automatically assigned to the current store.<br /><br />In edit mode, the list box on the left will display a list of all available stores. In order to associate a product to a store, one or more stores must be selected in the list box before clicking the <b>>></b> button which will create the association. Note that the default price Id is set to -1 which means that the standard product price will be used (which may be determined by the customer group). If the price Id is set to 0-3, then price 0 to price 3 are used, regardless of the customer group.<br /><br />Note that if a product is removed from the current store, then it will no longer be visible after clicking the save button. Note also that after assigning a product to a store, you must log into that store using this application and assign the product to one or more categories before it will be visible in the store front application.<br /><br />This panel is only available to Super Users.
help.protocol           = <b>HTTP / HTTPS</b><br /><br />KonaKart is configured using the configuration variables present within this section of the Administration Application. The variables are stored within the <b>configuration</b> database table and may be edited from this window.<br /><br />Changes may take a few seconds to become active because the application cache needs to be reloaded, and this happens on a scheduled basis at the frequency defined by the <b>Client config cache refresh check interval</b> configuration variable that can be edited by clicking the <b>Cache</b> sub-section of the <b>Configuration</b> menu.<br /><br />Most variables have float over text with a short description of their functionality.<br /><br />On this panel you can enable or disable the use of SSL and define related parameters.<br /><br />There are two ways to define the use of SSL on this panel.  One is to define the <b>port numbers</b> for HTTP mode and HTTPS mode respectively.  From these port values the secure redirect URL is derived.   The other choice is to define the <b>Base URL</b> for your SSL pages which overrides the standard derivation of the redirect URL and does not use the SSL port number definition.  For the <b>Base URL</b> you should use a string that defines what your requests should be from the outside before the request URI is appended to the end. If you use the standard SSL port you can remove that from the base URL definition.
