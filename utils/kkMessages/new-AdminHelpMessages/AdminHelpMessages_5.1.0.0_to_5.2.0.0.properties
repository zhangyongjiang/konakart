help.address      = This panel enables you to manage all addresses.<br/><br/>In a default installation it is invisible.
help.address.manu = This panel enables you to manage addresses for manufacturers.<br/><br/>Each manufacturer may be associated with multiple addresses. Note that the Default Addr check box is disabled because the notion of a primary or default address is not supported for manufacturer addresses..<br/><br/>The <b>Configuration>>AdminApp Configuration</b> section of the Admin App allows you to define how the address is formatted for display purposes in this panel.
help.address.prod = This panel enables you to manage addresses for products.<br/><br/>Each product may be associated with multiple addresses, one of which can defined as being the primary address. Each address may be associated to multiple products, which is useful for instance when the address is used to define a drop shipper who may be responsible for more than one product. .<br/><br/>The <b>Select Addr</b> button allows you to select an address from a list in a dialog box. The default number of addresses displayed before and after a search may be customized in the <b>Configuration>>AdminApp Configuration</b> section of the Admin App. This section of the admin app also allows you to define how the address is formatted in the select dialog box as well as in the main panel. Note that an address may be searched for using the company name since products will normally be associated to companies such as drop shippers. When the <b>Select </b> button is clicked in the dialog box after selecting one or more addresses, you are returned to the address panel and will see the new addresses in the list. .<br/><br/>The <b>Remove</b> button allows you to remove an address from a product without actually deleting it. The removed address may be re-associated with the product by selecting it from a list as explained above. The <b>Delete</b> button actually deletes the address rather than just removing the link between the address and the product. If the address is being used by other products, you are warned of this in a confirmation pop-up and can decide to cancel the delete request. .<br/><br/>If the address is edited and the <b>Save</b> button is clicked, the changes will apply for all products using this address. The only attribute that is unique to any one product is the <b>Default Addr</b> check box. This means that this address may be the default address for one product and not for another one. .<br/><br/>The <b>New</b> button allows you insert a new address which will automatically be associated with this product and be made available for other products in the selection dialog box.
help.address.cust = This panel enables you to manage addresses for customers.<br/><br/>Each customer may be associated with multiple addresses, one of which can defined as being the primary or default address. Note that the default address may not be unchecked. In order to remove the default address tag from an address, another address must be made default. Note also that the default address may not be deleted and that if a customer has only one address, then it cannot be deleted because a customer has to have a minimum of one address which can only be deleted by deleting the customer..<br/><br/>The <b>Configuration>>AdminApp Configuration</b> section of the Admin App allows you to define how the address is formatted for display purposes in this panel.
help.messages     = <b>Messages</b><br /><br />For maintaining the messages used in the Storefront Application and the Admin Application when you are using database-based messages.<br /><br />By default there are three message types: 1 = Application, 2 = Admin Application and 3 = Admin Application Help Messages. Additional message types can be added so that they appear in the message type droplists by modifying the <b>MESSAGE_TYPES</b> configuration variable (see Configuration >> Admin App Configuration to modify this value).<br /><br />You can either specify that your system should use file-based messages (the default) or database-based messages.   You define your choice by setting the "Use Database For Messages" option to true on the Configuration >> Admin App Configuration panel.
help.reviews      = This panel allows you to manage product reviews written by customers. Reviews can be edited and deleted.<br /><br />The storefront application may be configured so that when a review is entered, it is in an invisible state until and administrator validates the content and sets the state to visible. Alternatively he may decide not to approve the review (rather than deleting it) so that it remains invisible but the state is changed so that he knows that he doesn't have to review it again . The configuration variable to configure this behaviour, may be found in the <b>Configuration >> Security and Auditing</b> section of the admin app. If the default state for reviews (through this configuration variable) is set to 1 (Invisible state), then they will not be displayed on the storefront until the state is changed using this panel.
