help.editCustomerPoints = This panel allows you to manage the reward points of a customer. Whenever points are added to or removed from a customer's account, a transaction record is created which may have an optional <b>code</b> and <b>description</b>. The code is intended to categorize the type of transaction such as  ORDER, REG or REV if the points are generated due to an order or because a customer has registered or because he has written a review etc. The description is intended to provide a more verbose explanation which the customer can view in the store front application after logging in.<br/><br/>Using this panel, the administrator may assign and deduct points from a customer's account by clicking either the <b>Add Points</b> or <b>Remove Points</b> button. In both cases, a new transaction record is created which may have its own code and description. After adding or removing points, the panel is refreshed and the new total is visible as well as the new transaction record.
help.paymentSchedules   = This panel allows you to set up payment schedules for recurring billing.  A payment schedule defines how payments for a product may be organized over time by setting the time interval and the total number of payments. If the <b>Number of Payments</b> field is set to -1 this implies that the payments will go on indefinitely until the subscription is disabled. The <b>Day of Month</b> field allows you to specify a particular day of the month in monthly billing scenarios.<br/><br/>A product may be associated with a Payment Schedule in order to trigger the creation of a recurring billing subscription when an order is confirmed by a customer.
help.pdfConfig          = <b>PDF Configuration</b><br /><br />These are the configuration parameters for PDF document creation in your store. <br /><br />These are only used in the Enterprise Extensions Edition of KonaKart.<br /><br />You can define the <b>PDF Directory</b> path where PDF files will be created.  <br /><br />In the case of the Invoices, when KonaKart creates these it stores only the part of the file name after the base path so that the full file name can be generated by concatenating the base path configuration value with the storeId (or "store1" in single-store mode) and the invoice file name attribute on the order object.  This allows you to move the generated documents to a new home just so long as you re-configure the base path configuration value.
help.stockOrders        = <b>Stock and Orders Configuration</b><br /><br />As with other Configuration Settings, you can modify of these values and refresh the caches (see under the <b>Tools</b> menu) to see them have an instant effect (although some that affect the Admin App require you to log out then log in again). <br /><br /><b>Show Invisible Products</b> : Set to <b>true</b> to show "invisible" products in the Admin App, or set to <b>false</b> if you don't want them to be appear in the Admin App.<br /><br /><b>Stock Reorder Class</b> : The name of a java class that implements code that you want to execute when a product needs to be reordered. See the detailed customization documentation for more information. <br /><br /><b>Order Integration Class</b> : The name of a java class that implements code that you want to execute when an order changes status.  See the detailed customization documentation for more information.<br /><br /><b>Use Rich Text Editor</b> : Select <b>true</b> to use the Rich Text Editor for editing product descriptions in the Admin App. Select <b>false</b> to use a Plain Text Editor for this purpose.
help.subscriptions      = This panel allows you to manage recurring billing subscriptions. A subscription is normally inserted automatically by the system when an order is placed, if that order contains one or more products that have been configured with payment schedules. The payment schedule mainly defines the frequency of payments. The actual recurring billing transactions may be executed by payment gateways that support this functionality, or they may be executed by a batch program that reads the subscription objects from the database and decides whether a payment is due. <br/><br/>The subscriptions may be searched for using either the subscription code, the order id (or order number) or the customer id of the customer who created the order. The subscription code is a unique code that is normally returned by the payment gateway when a subscription is created. If a gateway isn't being used to manage the subscription, then the code may be left empty. If the <b>Has Problem</b> checkbox is set, then the only subscriptions returned are those that aren't functioning properly during the actual billing transaction. Note that the panel may be configured to display the numeric order id or the order number, by setting the configuration variable in the <b>Configuration >> Admin App Configuration</b> section of the Admin App.<br/><br/>Most of the attributes are self explanatory. The <b>Amount</b> defines the amount that will be billed at regular intervals. Some payment gateways also support a <b>Trial Amount </b> which is the value billed during a trial period defined by the payment schedule. A subscription may be enabled / disabled using the <b>Active</b> checkbox. If payments aren't being accepted by the payment gateway, then the problem attribute will be set and a description may be written to the description attribute to identify the source of the problem. i.e. The credit card has expired. These attributes will normally be written by the program making the payments or by a return message from the payment gateway.<br /><br />Click the <b>Payment Info</b> button to go to a panel showing all payments that have been made for this subscription including the response of the payment gateway.
help.templates          = <b>Velocity Templates Configuration</b><br /><br />These are the configuration parameters for the Velocity Templates in your store. <br /><br />You can define the <b>Templates Directory</b> path where the velocity template files will be created.<br /><br />The Velocity templates for each store are stored separately under another sub directory which has the name of the store id but you should not specify this value here as it is added by KonaKart automatically. By default the location for the Velocity Templates is a directory called <b>templates</b> under the installation home of KonaKart although it may be changed by modifying the value of this configuration variable.
