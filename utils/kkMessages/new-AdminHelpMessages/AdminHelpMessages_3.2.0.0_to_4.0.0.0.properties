help.editProductsDownloads = The <b>File Path</b> and <b>Content Type</b> are used for Digital Download products. The File Path is the path of a file containing the digital product. This path will be appended to the <b>Base Path</b> defined by a configuration variable. Therefore for example, the Base Path could be "C:/images/" and the file path could be "cities/london.jpg". Note that if the Base Path ends with a "/" then the file path should not start with a "/" because the two strings are concatenated to create the full path for the digital product. The Content Type describes the content of the file. Examples are "image/jpeg" or "application/pdf".<br /><br />The <b>Max Download Days</b> attribute defines the maximum number of days the product can be downloaded for. It defaults to -1 which means that the global value defined by the DD_MAX_DOWNLOAD_DAYS configuration variable is used. If set to a positive number, then this value will override the global value.<br /><br />The <b>Max Number Downloads</b> attribute defines the maximum number of times which the product can be downloaded. It defaults to -1 which means that the global value defined by the DD_MAX_DOWNLOADS configuration variable is used. If set to a positive number, then this value will override the global value.
