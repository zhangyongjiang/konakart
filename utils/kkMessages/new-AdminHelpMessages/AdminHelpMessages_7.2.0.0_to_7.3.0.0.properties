help.taxAreas           = A tax area or geographical zone is an area which may span multiple physical areas such as countries or states. In KonaKart it is used for defining tax areas which share a tax rate and for geographical areas used when setting up shipping and payment modules to define where these modules may be used. e.g. A certain shipping module may only be used for domestic and not international shipping.
