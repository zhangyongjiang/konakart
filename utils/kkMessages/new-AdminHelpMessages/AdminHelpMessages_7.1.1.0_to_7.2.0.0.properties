help.cacheConfig       = <b>Caching</b><br /><br />KonaKart is configured using the configuration variables present within this section of the Administration Application. The variables are stored within the <b>configuration</b> database table and may be edited from this panel.<br /><br />Changes may take a few seconds to become active because the application cache needs to be reloaded, and this happens on a scheduled basis at the frequency defined by the <b>Client config cache refresh check interval</b> configuration variable that can be edited on this panel.<br /><br />Do not tick the checkbox on the right of each configuration parameter if you do not want it to be returned by the storefront APIs.  If you do not need a configuration variable to be returned by the storefront APIs uncheck the field to improve performance and security.<br /><br />In the Enterpise version of KonaKart you can choose to <b>enable or disable the caching</b> of Products and/or Product Image names<br /><br />See the User Guide for more details on how to configure caching in KonaKart.<br /><br />Most variables have float over text with a short description of their functionality.
