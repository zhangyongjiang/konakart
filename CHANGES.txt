Changes with KonaKart 7.3.0.1 - Released 27-Aug-2014
====================================================

  *) Fixed a security vulnerability in Struts-2


Changes with KonaKart 7.3.0.0 - Released 19-Aug-2014
====================================================
  
  *) The storefront now uses a responsive design to optimally adapt to mobile devices
     with different screen resolutions.
  
  *) Now possible to define the order of the sections in the Admin Application
     using File-Based Configuration

  *) Options for defining Admin user password validity and expiry period.
  
  *) Generated passwords now have a mixture of lower case, upper case, numeric and 
     special characters
  
  *) When creating a new customer in the Administration Application the chosen password 
     must now conform to the password validity rules defined for the site.

  *) Current password is now required to modify the email address using the storefront 
     application.

  *) Now possible to assign the same admin role to the same user in different stores. 
     Previously it was necessary to have separate roles per store to define this.

  *) Upgraded to ANT 1.9.3
 
  *) Upgraded to GWT 2.6.0
 
  *) Added the option to add "Other" gender in addition to Male and Female.  Default is to
     show just Male and Female but you can set the ENABLE_OTHER_GENDER configuration parameter 
     in the Admin Application if you wish to enable "Other" gender.

  *) Added validation support to droplist and radio button template based custom product 
     attributes. Allows you to default to an invalid value in order to force a selection. 

  *) Added Authorize Direct Post Method (DPM) to simplify PCI compliance. When using this
     payment method, the credit card details never enter your servers.

  *) Added Authorize Payment Tokenization (CIM) to simplify PCI compliance. CIM allows a 
     customer to store and manage his credit cards without these cards ever entering your
     servers. During checkout a customer may decide to pay using a stored card (CIM) or by 
     entering card details using the Direct Post Method (DPM).

  *) Added new attributes to the customer object to store various tax-related attributes 
     and reference ids used to look up the customer in external systems.  
 
  *) Added Paymetric Payment Gateway
 
  *) Added Thomson Reuters Tax Order Total Module

  *) Log into the Admin App by entering username and password then hitting ENTER key - no longer 
     necessary to click on the Login button.
  
  *) Added getRMACode() method to the OrderIntegrationMgr where it can be modified to add
     your own algorithm for creating an RMA code. The output of this method is used to 
     automatically populate the RMA code field in the Admin App when inserting a new 
     Returns object.
 
  *) Added a new "User Defined" panel to the Administration Application that allows you to display 
     custom configuration parameters.  Any configuration parameters added to configuration group 
     number 31 will appear on the User Defined panel.  Enterprise Only.
 
  *) Added support for Customer.firstName, Customer.lastName, Address.firstName and Address.lastName
     in Custom Validation allowing the definition of the validation rules for these attributes.

  *) Added a new KKEng API call to validate the password of a logged in user.
  
  *) Added new KKEng API calls to retrieve coupons based on coupon code and coupon id and
     to retrieve the promotions associated with a coupon.

  *) AdminCategory objects now populated with their lastAdded attribute from getCategory calls.
  
  *) On the Customer Communications Panel of the Administration Application the "All Customers"
     emailing option will now either send email to all visible customers or all visible 
     registered customers depending on whether the "Only Registered Customers" checkbox is
     checked.

  *) WSDL files (for the storefront service and the admin service) provided with meaningful 
     parameter names (rather than in0, in1 etc). 

  *) Upgraded to Apache Tomcat 7.0.54.

  *) Java 8 runtime support added.   Java 6, Java 7 and Java 8 are all supported.

  *) Added a new Interceptor class (NoCache) to the storefront application's Struts configuration
     to expire pages so that they aren't visible by using the browser's back button.  This is a 
     security / privacy measure.

  *) From the Administration Application, Manufacturer images are uploaded by default to the
     concatenation of the image base path (a configuration variable), the defined "manufacturer" 
     image directory (defined in File-based configuration) and the source filename.  Sample
     manufacturer images have been restored to the default set-up as examples.

  *) The deleteManufacturer KKAdminIf API call now removes the Manufacturer's image file from disk 
     if it exists. 

  *) New KKAdminIf API calls - addImage and removeImage.  addImage allows you to add an image to 
     a product or a manufacturer in a standard fashion so that you can view it in the Administration
     Application.

  *) Added functionality to the Admin App to enable you to remove product prices and quantities
     from a catalog.

  *) Modified the Coupons panel in the Admin App so that after editing a coupon it remains
     selected.  
 
  *) Enhanced the functionality for creating data entry widgets for configuring promotions. You 
     can now define a rich text editor and add validation to the widget definitions.  

  *) Modified the Admin API call editOrder() to include the OrderProduct custom fields.
  
  *) Modified the Admin App popup window to select categories for promotion rules. The categories
     are now displayed in a collapsible tree view.
 
Bug Fixes
---------

  *) Added a new report - OrdersInLast25DaysChart to replace the OrdersInLast30DaysChart
     report which reported orders in the previous month inaccurately.  The earlier
     version is retained but its use is deprecated.
 
  *) GeoZone checking for shipping and payment modules was not working correctly for GeoZones 
     mapped to a country when that country had no defined zones.

  *) The payment method drop list was not being updated on changes to the billing address
     on the checkout screen.  

  *) Some source files deployed under the custom directory were mistakenly placed in two 
     directories which could have led to incorrect versions being built into jars.  This
     has been fixed so that no duplicates are now deployed.

  *) The number of logons and the last logon time was not being populated on the customer
     object when returned using the storefront server eCommerce engine.

  *) When in mode that allows checkout without registration, the password entry fields 
     would disappear after changing country when attempting to register. 

  *) Fix to struts.xml to prevent CVE-2014-0094 vulnerability.
  
  *) Added security enhancement to the storefront application to prevent XSRF attacks. 
     Thanks to Christian Schneider for reporting the issue. 
  
  *) Modified TotalDiscount, BuyXGetYFree and ShippingDiscount to deduct tax after 
     applying the discounts.

  *) The customer group was being reset by the storefront application whenever a customer
     updated his details.

  *) Certain product search-related queries were not being logged when the DB Logging flag
     was set to INFO.  The logging of these queries have now been added. (The log4j log 
     flag to set to log the SQL is log4j.logger.com.konakart.db = INFO).
 
  *) When returning an array of reviews, the application engine was not calculating the 
     average review score properly whenever an offset was set in the DataDescriptor
     parameter.	 

  *) A Solr search no longer returns products that do not have catalog prices or quantities
     defined. This matches the search results when Solr isn't enabled. Note that suggested
     search returns all enabled products.
 
  *) KKAppEng start-up was not looking up alternative property filenames
     via the customisable PropertyFileNames class.
 
  *) Fixes problem with uploading Digital Download files in the Admin App.
  
  *) Under certain conditions the Admin Application About box was reporting the wrong version 
     number of the Admin Engine being used.

  *) The Admin API call getSubscriptions() was not filtering correctly when using the 
     lastBillingDate filter.

Backwards Compatibility Alert
-----------------------------

  *) A number of classes have been moved from the konakart.jar to the konakart_custom.jar.
     This has been done to make it much easier to customise these classes and re-generate 
     the konakart_custom.jar by using the standard ANT build in the custom directory. The 
     classes that have been moved are:
       *\custom\appn\src\com\konakart\bl\modules\ordertotal\OrderTotalInterface.java
       *\custom\appn\src\com\konakart\bl\modules\ordertotal\OrderTotalMgr.java
       *\custom\appn\src\com\konakart\bl\modules\others\AddrValidationInterface.java
       *\custom\appn\src\com\konakart\bl\modules\payment\PaymentInfo.java
       *\custom\appn\src\com\konakart\bl\modules\payment\PaymentInterface.java
       *\custom\appn\src\com\konakart\bl\modules\payment\PaymentMgr.java
       *\custom\appn\src\com\konakart\bl\modules\shipping\ShippingInfo.java
       *\custom\appn\src\com\konakart\bl\modules\shipping\ShippingInterface.java
       *\custom\appn\src\com\konakart\bl\modules\shipping\ShippingMgr.java
       *\custom\appn\src\com\konakart\bl\modules\shipping\WeightCost.java
 
  *) Publish Products and Google Shopping functionality has been removed due to the demise of
     Google Base then Google Shopping.

  *) Modified the Admin API call editOrder() to include the OrderProduct custom fields.
     This change should be backwards compatible but it's good to be aware of it.

  *) The mobile storefront is no longer included in the download package since the 
     storefront now has a responsive design. 

  *) Default tomcat AJP 1.3 Connector on port changed from port 8789 to 8788.  These can
     be changed freely to suit your local requirements.


Changes with KonaKart 7.2.0.0 - Released 06-Mar-2014
====================================================
  
  *) Added support for real time credit card refunds through the payment gateway,
     which can be managed from within the Admin App. The full details of the refund
     transactions are saved in the database. This is an Enterprise Only feature.
  
  *) Added support for Shippers and Shipments. Multiple shipments may be defined
     for a single order. The shipments (including tracking number) can be included 
     in a notification eMail and are visible from the order details page of the 
     storefront application. 
 
  *) Performance Improvement : Upgrade to Torque 4 - keeps up-to-date with the latest
     version of Torque which helps to provide an overall performance improvement in 
     KonaKart of approximately 10%-20%.  (Based on timings made before and after the upgrade
     to Torque 4 when running a broad cross-section of test suites).  Upgraded to the
     ojdbc6.jar Oracle JDBC driver.

  *) Performance Improvement : Product Caching (Enterprise Only).  Choice of caches 
     available: KonaKart (on heap, POJO), Ehcache (on heap, byte arrays) and Big
     Memory Go (off heap, byte array).

  *) Added two new types of product options. KonaKart now supports 4 different types:
     1) The Standard type is where each option value defines a product attribute which 
        may or may not modify the price of the product (e.g. Small, Medium and Large for
        an option called Size or Black, Brown and Red for an option called Color).
     2) The Customer Text type option allows a customer to enter text which for example 
        could be used to personalize the product with a name, initials or a greeting.
     3) The Variable Quantity type is an option, the value of which may take a customer 
        defined quantity. It can be used for example to specify the required amount of 
        disk storage required when configuring a cloud based computer.
     4) The Customer Price type allows the customer to enter a price for the option. 
        This could for example be used for making donations.
     Types 2 - 4 are Enterprise Only.
  
  *) Added CustomStoreService and CustomAdminService - a framework and set of utilities to
     create custom functionality alongside the KonaKart services.  A utility is provided 
     to make it easy to create SOAP versions of these custom services.  These can be used 
     alongside the KKEngIf and KKAdminIf engines to provide custom services that you may 
     need to supplement the standard KonaKart functionality for your unique requirements.
     Examples provided for you to customize to make it easy to implement.

  *) Added support for spelling suggestions when a search returns no results.

  *) Added functionality to be able to set the sort order of product options such as size
     and color.  

  *) Added a new "Virtual Product" type for a product that doesn’t ship and isn’t 
     downloaded. It may be used for services like extra warranty or 1 hour of tuition etc.

  *) Added functionality to the Admin App to be able to decide whether to send 
     Newsletters to everyone who has signed up or just to registered customers.
 
  *) New KKEvent mechanism to signal key events in the system such as updates of products.
     Initially this is only used for Cache Management functions but its use will be
     extended.

  *) New set of Custom Panels that can be arranged in each section of the Administration
     Application for more flexible integration of custom administrative features.

  *) Added an example Admin Application to insert a product using a very user friendly
     wizard driven interface. The application can be run in a custom panel. The application
     (including full source code) is available to Enterprise customers so that it can be 
     used as a starting point for developing custom admin functionality.  An ANT task called 
     make_eclipse_wizard_project has been provided to create an Eclipse project for this 
     example application.

  *) Added the ability to configure the role privileges on the Customers For Reviews column
     of the Administration Application (as for the Customers for Orders panel).

  *) Set the logon count and the last logged on date for users of the Administration App.
  
  *) Added security enhancement to the storefront application to prevent XSRF attacks. 
  
  *) Added quantity droplist to the storefront application to select quantity before adding
     product to cart. 
  
  *) Modified the Order Status objects so that the Order Status Id is no longer a part of 
     the primary key. 

  *) Added an order total module which can be configured to add a charge based on the 
     selected payment method.

  *) Updated the version of Solr to 4.6.0
  
  *) Added a method in the AdminProductSolrMgr that can be overridden in order to index 
     all product related data that isn't automatically indexed. e.g. Data from product 
     custom fields.

  *) Added a tokenizer to the Solr search string to be able to search for the keywords 
     within the search string AND'ed together rather than an exact match on the string. 
     e.g. The search string "rotary lawnmower" is converted to rotary AND lawnmower.

  *) Added functionality to return a Solr score for searches and to be able to sort by
     the search score.

  *) When reading an order (through the Admin APIs) retrieve the FirstName and LastName 
     of the user who updated an Order as well as the updatedById.  These values are now 
     made available for use in the Order templates.

  *) Allow the definition of whether the assignment of products to stores is allowed
     using role-based configuration rather than only allowing super users this privilege.
     (See Custom1 setting on the Privileges of the Edit Products Panel).

  *) Hide the Set Language link in the Administration Application if only 1 language
     is defined.

  *) Enhanced search for orders and reviews - now possible to search for between specified 
     last modified dates.

  *) Removed the maximum length on text fields in the Store Maintenance window of the 
     Administration Application to allow greater flexibility in using the store custom 
     fields for bespoke purposes.

  *) Enhanced mail APIs to be able to specify a dynamic list of bcc recipients.
  
  *) By setting a new logging flag a clearer representation of all SQL being executed can
     be logged making it far easier to track down problems in customised code. Time taken by 
     each query is also logged which is very useful information when tracking down 
     performance issues and helping you to tune the database for optimum performance.
     Simply set log4j.logger.com.konakart.db = INFO in your konakart-logging.properties file
     to see the SQL.
  
  *) For application engine API calls that return an array of products you can now 
     configure the API call to add the product options and the comparison data
     attribute is returned together with the description when the API calls are configured
     to return the description.

  *) Multiple coupon codes may now be entered for an order to activate multiple promotions. 
  
  *) Improvements to the utility provided to set up KonaKart as a Windows Service.  The default
     tomcat wrappers are now 64' versions and not 32' versions as previously.   This is better
     for most users as the jvm.dll used must be bit-compatible with the wrapper and most users 
     nowadays are using 64' JVMs.

  *) Now possible to pass the sessionId through to Quartz batch jobs. You define a parameter
     in your konakart_jobs.xml file with the value SESSION_ID and this gets substituted with
     the sessionId of the user executing the Quartz job at runtime.

Bug Fixes
---------

  *) Fixed paging problems in 3 API calls;
      getOrderHistory(WithOptions)
      getAlsoPurchased(WithOptions)
      getRelatedProducts(WithOptions)
     The result wasn't correct when an offset was set in the DataDescriptor.
 
  *) The products ordered count (used to determine how popular a product is) wasn't being 
     updated when KonaKart was configured to not subtract stock levels on receipt of
     an order.
 
  *) Modified the Shipping Order Total module to not return a value of $0 if no shipping
     quote is found. Now it returns null and the application stops checkout if no module
     is found.

  *) In the scenario whereby you remove a category then add a category without modifying 
     any data on the new category, the category tree was not being updated on the storefront.
     In these circumstances the category tree is now updated.

  *) Fixed a storefront bug that was occurring in the case where a customer created a wedding
     list before a normal wish list. The wish list was always showing as empty.

  *) Product Synchronization: The admin app wasn't displaying invisible products.

  *) Product Synchronization: No longer existing product relations were not being deleted.
  
Backwards Compatibility Alert
-----------------------------

  *) The sort order of product options such as size and color is now determined by a
     sort order attribute which is set automatically by the admin app when the product
     is saved. Until this attribute has been set correctly, the sort order may not be the
     same as it was in the previous version of KonaKart.

  *) With the upgrade to Torque 4 there are a number of database-related changes to be aware 
     of.  See the "Upgrade to Torque 4" section in the User Guide.


Changes with KonaKart 7.1.1.0 - Released 05-Sep-2013
====================================================
  
  *) Added search by manufacturer ascending and descending in order to search for 
     products using the Application and Admin engines. Previously only 
     ascending was available.
  
  *) Added new method getBundlesThatProductsBelongTo() to return an array of bundles plus
     bundled products for an array of products passed in as a parameter. Allows you 
     to determine (and fetch) the bundles that contain all of the specified products.

  *) Added a mechanism to optionally include the template name in the product custom 
     attribute labels in the Edit Product panel of the Admin App. Also, the
     custom fields may be grouped into a collapsible panel for each template.

  *) Updated the Administration Application's StyleSheet used when deployed as a portlet
     under Liferay.

  *) Removed the Cookie Warning from the Storefront Application when deployed as a portlet
     under Liferay.

  *) Set more fields for the new KonaKart user that is created when automatically logged on from
     Liferay.  eg. Use the country of the store.  This can be customised as required as the 
     KKAdminPortlet.java file is provided as source code.

  *) New getProductImages API call for the storefront engine (KKEngIf) - can be used to 
     retrieve the names of images associated with a specified product.

  *) Ehcache introduced for faster access to image names associated with products.

  *) More flexible image scaling can be configured when uploading product images. Notably,
     aspect ratios can be retained.

  *) Allow the definition of 5 (not 3) custom relationship types in the product relationships
     droplist in the Admin Application (under Edit Product).

Bug Fixes
---------

  *) Fixed a bug whereby in multi-store mode, the related products within carousels
     in the product detail page of the storefront app, were sometimes not picking up
     the correct currency.
 
  *) Fixed a storefront bug which was causing the customer to redirect to the checkout
     page when changing the country during an edit address and then clicking the back
     button rather than the save button.

  *) Fixed a suggested search problem to unescape HTML returned by Solr. The indexing
     of ampersand was causing the problem since Solr was returning &amp; in the 
     suggested search results.

  *) Added a '/' before KonakartAdmin.css in the liferay-portlet.xml to ensure the style
     sheet file is found on all Liferay platforms.
  
  *) Fixed a bug in the admin app to allow an administrator to register a customer 
     if the email address already exists in the database for a non registered customer.
     The admin engine was allowing the registration but wasn't deleting the non 
     registered customer.

  *) Fixed a storefront bug that was causing an error when checking out as a non 
     registered customer and clicking the order confirmation breadcrumb. 
  
  *) Fixed a storefront bug that was causing a null pointer error when paging a set 
     of products containing a product in multiple categories where a category is 
     invisible and solr is enabled

Changes with KonaKart 7.1.0.0 - Released 08-Aug-2013
====================================================
  
  *) Multi-Vendor functionality allowing vendors to manage their own products and orders
     and customers to buy products from multiple vendors in a single order.
  
  *) New panel in the Admin App allowing you to maintain your store's Velocity Templates.

  *) New functionality allowing you to associate stores with addresses. 

  *) Add vertical scrollbars to panels when there is a large number of data rows to 
     display (such as in View Logs, Importer, Templates panels etc).

  *) A number of template changes to modify the output according to the setting of the 
     "DISPLAY_PRICE_WITH_TAX" configuration variable.

  *) Significant improvements in performance for the import messages API call.
  
  *) Ability to configure personal preferences in the Admin App (eg. to define the number 
     of products returned in each group on the Products Panel).

  *) Additions to the Data Integrity Checker to include checks for Product, Category
     and Manufacturer data.

  *) Made AdminStoreIntegrationMgr.java available in the custom directory to make it 
     easier to add and build custom functionality when new stores are created in a 
     multi-store environment. 

  *) Increased the maximum number of Payment Schedule objects visible in the drop lists
     in the EditProduct and Subscription panels from 100 to 1000.  

  *) Upgraded to BIRT 4.3.0
  
  *) Added a new option to the FetchProductOptions object in the Application API to
     programmably allow returned products to be populated with tags. Normally for
     performance reasons they are only populated when retrieving a single product.

  *) More flexibility in uploading images in different formats in the Administration
     Application.  See FBC (File-Based Configuration for details).

  *) Delete button added to remove product images.

  *) Added section to storefront application to prompt customer to accept cookies.  
  
  *) The storefront application can now be configured to force a customer to login in
     order to use it.

Bug Fixes
---------

  *) Various configuration parameters were not set corrected when using the silent 
     installation and specifying a target installation directory containing a "~" on
     Windows.

  *) Allow the saving of Manufacturer details after a new language has been added in 
     the Admin Application.
  
  *) Customers/Products/Categories shared attributes not being set properly by the 
     installer for the konakart-m webappp.

  *) Added a "--None--" option for tax class droplists in the Admin App to accurately
     reflect the status of the tax class.  

  *) Shipping wasn't being recalculated when the delivery address was changed from 
     the order confirmation page.
  
  *) Some security improvements in the storefront application.
  
  *) Modified storefront and mobile storefront applications to avoid (in some cases) 
     the SEO modified URL from continually growing in size rather than being reset 
     to display only the current relevant SEO data.

  *) Modified Solr product loading code to not throw an exception if a product 
     description exists for a language that has been deleted.
  
Backwards Compatibility Alert
-----------------------------

  *) AdminStoreIntegrationMgrInterface.java has been moved to the blif directory. If you 
     have created your own AdminStoreIntegrationMgr.java class you need to change it
     to implement com.konakartadmin.blif.AdminStoreIntegrationMgrInterface instead of 
     com.konakartadmin.bl.AdminStoreIntegrationMgrInterface.


Changes with KonaKart 7.0.0.0 - Released 12-Jun-2013
====================================================
  
  *) CKEditor 4.1 integrated in the Enterprise version of the Admin Application.  This provides
     an alternative to the Plain Text and the Rich Text Editors.

  *) Added new functionality that allows a product to be associated with multiple custom
     attribute templates. This helps the re-use of templates between different product 
     categories. 

  *) Added new method getBundlesThatProductBelongsTo() to return an array of bundles plus
     bundled products for any product passed in as a parameter. Allows you to determine
     (and fetch) the bundles that contain a specified product.

  *) Added a sitemap generation batch (EE only) that will generate an XML sitemap to 
     inform search engines about pages that are available for crawling. The sitemap files
     include links to all products, categories and static pages.

  *) Added a new Importer Panel for custom import routines. See User Guide for details.

  *) Added a new Reset Database tool to clear out all non-essential data (for example to 
     remove all the sample product data).  Use with care!.   The Reset Database option on
     the Tools menu of the Admin App can be replaced by any custom Tool that you wish to
     configure it its place.  See User Guide for details.

 
Bug Fixes
---------

  *) Aligned the Configuration variables between the sample "store2" store and "store1".
     (Display the Configuration variables in the same panels in each store).
  
  *) Fixed a storefront bug in Internet Explorer. When a product was added to the cart a 
     second time from the product details screen, it wasn't working because IE wasn't sending 
     the AJAX command since it had cached the original result.

  *) Price slider and price facets were not displaying the price correctly when KonaKart
     was configured to display product prices including tax.
 
  *) Order total in order confirmation screen was not being displayed in the correct currency
     when not using the default currency.

  
Backwards Compatibility Alert
-----------------------------

  *) 

 
Changes with KonaKart 6.6.0.0 - Released 04-May-2013
====================================================
  
  *) Storefront application for mobile devices. The storefront has been designed for 
     customers using mobile phones and tablet computers. It allows you to access all
     of the functionality using touch rather than by use of the mouse.
  
  *) Now possible to create a portlet for Liferay based on the new Struts-2 version.
  
  *) Allow case insensitive searches on a selection of fields on customer and product
     from the Admin Application and by using the KKAdminIf API. This is useful if you're 
     using a database like PostgreSQL, Oracle or DB2 which by default use case sensitive 
     searches.  For the Admin App the field-by-field behaviour can be configured using
     File-Based Configuration (Enterprise Only).
 
  *) Using role-based configuration it is now possible to make the "custom" button on
     the customers panel invisible for certain users but visible for others.

  *) New Scheduler panel in the Administration Application for monitoring and executing
     Batch jobs defined for the system.  A number of new Admin APIs have been added to
     support this feature and also provide programmatic access to the batch jobs.

  *) Upgrade to Struts 2.3.8
  
  *) Upgrade to Quartz 2.1.7

  *) Added two extra custom fields to custom attribute descriptors.

  *) Upgraded the Admin Application to use Google Web Toolkit 2.5.1
  
  *) Added userId to the Audit panel to make it easier to find out which user was responsible
     for each change.  User name and User email also added to the detail section for each
     audit record display.

  *) Integration of USPS address validation (Enterprise Only) and framework for adding other
     address validation services.

  *) Added 6 new custom fields to the products_description table.  This allows access to more
     language-specific custom fields for more flexibility.  These can be edited in the KonaKart
     Administration Application on the Edit Product Panel.

  *) Added transient customObj attributes to CustomerIf and ProductIf for use in holding custom
     objects on these key KonaKart objects.   Note that these are transient objects and will not
     take part in standard KonaKart API operations.  A typical use would be to populate these
     custom object attributes after the Product or Customer has been returned from a KonaKart 
     API (this could be in a custom engine where you have created your own getProduct() or 
     getCustomer() calls for example).

  *) Added mechanism to validate that all required order total objects are present before allowing
     checkout. It is mainly important for tax and shipping modules that interface with an external
     service which may be down.

  *) Added the ability to tail logs from the Admin App.

 
Bug Fixes
---------

  *) Not picking up all of the access rights correctly on the Customers for Orders panel of 
     the Admin App. This affected control over the reviews button and to allow the return of 
     invisible customers.
     
  *) Fixed a storefront bug that was not allowing customers to register when in the mode that
     allows customers to checkout without registration.

  *) Race conditions at startup of the Admin App caused the image upload servlet URL definition 
     not to be initialised in time for its use.  This has been fixed so that the definition of the
     image upload servlet URL should always be initialised properly before use.

  *) Fix image uploads for the original version of the image tab. It was displaying existing
     images OK but new uploads were failing.

  *) Filtering search results by price in the storefront application was only working correctly
     when using the default currency.

  *) Added missing classes into konakartadmin_gwt.jar to enable logging at the DEBUG level. The
     missing classes were used in certain debug statements when the debug level was set to
     DEBUG on log4j.logger.com.konakartadmin.server.
  
  *) Fixed a bug that prevented sendOrderConfirmationEmail1 from sending emails with invoices 
     attached
  
  *) Fixed a bug when in multi store shared products mode. When a product was removed from a 
     store but not deleted, the product count per manufacturer was still considering the removed 
     product in the count.
     This bug was only visible in the storefront when not using Solr. This bug was manifested when
     calling the engine API calls : getManufacturersPerCategory() and getManufacturers();

  
Backwards Compatibility Alert
-----------------------------

  *) Definitions in AdminSearchRules.properties have been moved to the 
     konakartadmin_gwt.properties file and are now pre-fixed by "sr.".  The original
     AdminSearchRules.properties file has been removed.

  *) If you used the getPdf(eng.getEngConf(), options) call on the AdminEngineMgrIf the template 
     name used (when the options type was set to KKConstants.HTML_NAMED_TEMPLATE) was retrieved 
     from options.getCustom1().  From version 6.6.0.0 the named template will be retrieved from the 
     options.getTemplateName() attribute.

 
Changes with KonaKart 6.5.1.0 - Released 05-Mar-2013
====================================================

  *) Upgrade the JDBC driver for MySQL to support the new MySQL 5.6.10.1 release. Also in
     connection with this, reduce the size of some key columns from VARCHAR(256) to 
     VARCHAR(255) to avoid "Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes" problems
     when using UTF-8 encoding in the new version of MySQL.

  *) Various UI changes to the storefront application:
      -Made product tile clickable
      -Increased size of product details image to stop truncation

Bug Fixes
---------

  *) Fixed a UI bug appearing in Chrome. In some occasions when hovering over the Wish
     link at the top of the page, the link would shift to the right and move the 
     Shopping Cart link to the next line.  
   
  *) UI bug in checkout confirmation page. Product links are broken after page is refreshed 
     using Ajax calls. e.g. change of shipping address. 
     
  *) UI bug in wish list page not displaying the total exclusive of tax.


Changes with KonaKart 6.5.0.0 - Released 10-Feb-2013
====================================================
  
  *) New storefront using struts2, JQuery and Ajax to give a more modern and functional
     user interface with less screen refreshes. Enterprise customers now get the full 
     source code of the client engine and an Eclipse project to easily customize all 
     parts of the storefront application.

  *) Implemented getPromotionResult() method for the FreeProduct promotion module so
     that it can be determined whether the promotion is active before adding a 
     product to the cart.
 
  *) Allow embedded spaces with custom attribute "Set" function definitions - eg. allow
     both string(1, 10) as well as string(1,10)

  *) Addition of PunchOut functionality complying to OCI Rel. 4 using HTML rather than 
     XML which was used for the previous implementation.

  *) Upgraded to Apache Solr 4.0

  *) Now allow 30 custom facet fields for Solr faceting instead of 10.

  *) Multiple facet constraints can now be added to each TagGroup when performing
     a faceted search with Solr.
   
  *) Added range facets for prices when using Solr.
 
  *) All Solr searches now return the minimum and maximum prices for products in the
     search results.
 
  *) Added a new API call (getTagGroupsPerCategoryWithOptions) which allows the
     fetching of tag groups without associated tags. The tags aren't required when
     using Solr for faceted search so it improves performance to not retrieve them. 
 
  *) Added attribute to ProductSearch object to force the use of Solr. 
     Normally Solr is only used when doing text searches or when returning 
     custom facets.

  *) Added catalog prices and quantities to Solr so that Solr searches can 
     be performed when using constraints on catalog prices and quantities. 

  *) Modified Solr schema.xml to add SynonymFilterFactory to the kkName field type.

  *) Modified the getManufacturersPerCategory() API call so that it returns the
     product count for each manufacturer even when not using Solr.
 
  *) Introduced a mechanism to easily allow a KonaKart customer to implement a 
     different password encryption algorithm. By default KonaKart uses the 
     MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm. The class that needs to be customized is 
     called Security.java and can be found under 
     KonaKart/custom/utils/src/com/konakart/util

  *) Return the custom attribute template id for products retrieved using
     the Application API.  

  *) Allow Custom Validation of Tag names, Tag Group Names and Tag Group
     Descriptions.  

  *) Now possible to override the default file name for KonaKart's Velocity
     properties file (default name is konakart_velocity.properties).  Also
     possible, using this customisation technique (see "KonaKart Properties
     Files" section in the User Guide) to specify different properties files
     for different environments (Dev, Test, QA, Prod etc).

  *) Introduced a getManufacturers API call to the storefront engine and 
     enhanced the existing getManufacturers API call on the admin engine to
     allow greater flexibility over searching for manufacturers - including 
     the possibility to retrieve and order manufacturers by their custom fields.

  *) Mask credit card numbers when written to the log in DEBUG mode (for
     enhanced PCI compliance).  

  *) Send additional parameters in PayPal module (first_name, last_name
     address1, address2 city, state, country, postcode)

  *) Added two new engine API calls ( addCustomerNotifications() and 
     deleteCustomerNotifications() ) to manage the signing up for newsletter
     and product notifications for registered and non registered customers. 

  *) Introduced a getReviews API call to the storefront engine to provide greater
     flexibility (more constraints and sort by options) when searching for reviews.
     The API call now also returns an array of review rating facets which show
     how many reviews are present for each rating.  

  *) A License Key is now required to run the Enterprise Extensions.   License keys
     are added in the KonaKart Admin App...  Ask sales@konakart.com for your 
     personalised keys.

  *) Improvements to the Installer for Linux platforms which now sets more
     platform-specific configuration parameters which saves time by avoiding 
     the need for manual configuration of these after installation.

  *) Enhancements and speed improvements to Google Base interface. Google's 
     "Product Type" is now derived from the position in the Category Tree.

  *) Introduction of product dimension attributes (length, width, depth)
  
  *) Product weight column expanded to allow 15 characters instead of just 5.
  
  *) The method splitNameIntoFirstAndLastNames() in BasePaymentModule has been
     deprecated with improved functionality being provided in the new 
     getFirstAndLastNamesFromAddress method.  All payment modules have been
     updated to use the new method as applicable.

  *) Validation of coupon code when inserting a coupon in the admin app is now
     configurable.
 
  *) Added the option to search for text in the product description in the 
     Admin App.

  *) Allow the possibility to specify "From Address" and "Reply To Address" on
     emails sent through the APIs.  

 
Bug Fixes
---------

  *) Added invoiceNumber to the recurring billing request sent to AuthorizeNet.
     This information stops AuthorizeNet from thinking that it is a repeat 
     request. 

  *) The array of Tags belonging to the TagGroup objects returned by the 
     getTagGroups() API call were not being fully populated. The id of the 
     tags was missing. This meant that it wasn't possible to add or remove a tag
     and call the updateTagGroup() API call.

  *) Fixed a bug that was causing an exception when an admin product query was 
     returning no products and isFillMiscItems() set to true.
     
  *) Problem making the Customer Reviews button invisible using the Role
     Privileges.  

  *) In certain configurations of Apache (notably with proxy servers being used)
     PDF viewing wasn't working.  Now fixed by adding application/pdf as the 
     content type.

  *) When setting up an expression, if the first variable displayed (Age of Customer)
     was used without modifying the default "greater than" operator, then the 
     generated expression would pick up the "equals" operator instead.

Backwards Compatibility Alert
-----------------------------

  *) v6.5.0.0 introduces the new Struts 2 based storefront.  By default the standard 
     installer (and its Enterprise partner) will install the new Struts 2 based 
     storefront.  So, for new installations, if you wish to install the 6.5.0.0 
     version of the Struts 1 based storefront you will need to first install the 
     standard Struts 2 based storefront, then you must run the Struts 1 installer 
     and its Enterprise partner if applicable).  For upgrade installations where 
     you wish to keep your previous version's Struts 1 based storefront the recommended
     approach is to:

     * Save your existing store front application somewhere safe before you start
     * uninstall KonaKart
     * Install all of the following in the same location over the top of eachother:
     * Using the standard installer, install the new Struts 2 based storefront (but do 
     not update the database using the installer)
     * If you're using the Enterprise version, install the standard Enterprise version 
     of the Struts 2 based storefront (again do not update the database using the 
     installer)
     * Install the Struts 1 based storefront (again do not update the database using 
     the installer).
     * If you're using the Enterprise version, install the Enterprise version of the
     Struts 1 based storefront installer (again do not update the database using the 
     installer)
     * Execute the upgrade SQL scripts for your database type for every release from 
     the one you started with to the latest.  Run these one at a time in sequence.
     * Move your previous Struts 1 based storefront code back into the konakart webapp
  
  *) The API call getManufacturersPerCategory() now returns manufacturers for products
     of the selected category and all of its children. The new getManufacturers() API
     call may be used to return the manufacturers for only the selected category.
 

Changes with KonaKart 6.4.0.0 - Released 11-Sep-2012
====================================================
  
  *) Addition of PunchOut functionality complying to OCI Rel. 4 . 
     Feature allows corporate users to create orders within their
     ERP systems.

  *) In file based configuration for admin app, added option to not set
     a date by default for the product Available Date.

  *) Allow the definition of integer(min,max) and double(min,max) for
     module configuration parameters (define using the set_function).

  *) Upgraded to Quartz 2.1.5
  
  *) Improvements to consistency of treatment of emails and more options to
     control email sending (content type, blind copies, synchronous/asynchronous).

  *) New FBC (File based configuration) properties added for configuring email usage
     in the Admin App (eg. defaults for BCCs and content type).

  *) Ability to create PDF files from custom templates (not just invoice,
     packing list and order details as before).  See PdfOptions.

  *) TemplateBase variable added to velocity context by default - useful for 
     specifying includes of style definitions for example.  Examples of the use of
     this in the default velocity templates.

  *) Extended the ability to add custom business objects to the Velocity context
     to make these available for the Velocity templates.  Now possible to add your
     own objects for Invoices, Order Details, Packing Slips and your own custom
     templates.

  *) ESC key can now be used to close Help dialogues in the Admin App.
  
  *) Allow the setting of a full path for the KonaKart and KonaKartAdmin properties
     files in their respective EngineConfig objects.  These properties files do not
     have to be on the classpath.  This can be handy for setting up different 
     properties files for different environments (DEV, TEST, PROD etc).

  *) Custom panels in the Admin App now get additional parameters (Display language 
     Id, Admin User Id and Store Id) appended to the specified URLs (Enterprise Only).    

  *) When sessions are found to have expired they are removed from the database.
  
  *) Added Global Collect Payment module

  *) As a diagnostic aid you can set "log4j.logger.com.konakartadmin.server = DEBUG"
     to reveal all the Admin API calls made by the Admin App as you use it.  
     Particularly useful when figuring out which methods to override in a custom 
     engine.
  
  *) Every time reviews are inserted or made visible / invisible or deleted, the related
     product is updated with the total review count and average rating. For performance
     considerations, the average rating is no longer calculated every time a product 
     is fetched through the API. A batch program has been added to the Enterprise version
     to traverse all of the products in the catalog and set the review count and 
     average rating.

  *) Modified the Enterprise installer to define the use of Enterprise versions of
     the SecurityMgr and AdminSecurityMgr classes by default.

  *) Default username changed from the irregular "root@localhost" to "doe@konakart.com"


Bug Fixes
---------

  *) Exception was being thrown if a currency was defined without a
     thousands separator.

  *) Problem solved with matching existing Customer Groups when importing using 
     the XML_IO  utility.

  *) Fixed the jQuery example shortcut which wasn't updated after the jQuery
     code was relocated in 6.3.0.0

  *) Fix a "Bad Request" exception in GoogleShopping interface when an attempt
     is made to delete a product that no longer exists.

  *) USA ePay payment gateway - the billing state is now specified as the state 
     ("Zone") code instead of the full state name (e.g. CA instead of California).

  *) updateOrder API call on the storefront engine wasn't setting the updated_by_id 
     correctly from the updateOrder object passed in as a parameter.  

  *) When uploading images using the Admin App a strange occasional "There has 
     been a problem with the upload <PRE></PRE>" error message would appear.  The 
     image upload was always successful despite this message.  This spurious error 
     message has now been eliminated.
  
  *) To support Custom Validation in the Admin App using a Custom Admin Engine it
     is now possible to hide the "More Details" button on the error dialog box 
     that is displayed in the Admin App when an exception is thrown from a Custom
     Admin Engine interface.

  *) The addRelatedProducts() Admin API call was setting the wrong quantity
     for bundle relationships when updating the relationship. This was only occurring 
     when the relationship already existed. 

  *) Drop lists in the custom field panel of admin app weren't being displayed properly
     in Internet Explorer.

  *) Under certain circumstances the payment method attribute was being saved 
     incorrectly on orders.  This was happening under certain conditions when multiple
     payment options were provided and the user switched between them.

  *) Address formatting was throwing an exception when the replacing string contained a 
     "$" character.

  *) CustomerId not being set under certain conditions in the Admin App when only one
     panel is authorised for the active role.  This caused errors when attempting to 
     run BIRT reports from the Admin App.


Backwards Compatibility Alert
-----------------------------

  *) With the upgrade of Quartz the syntax of the jobs definition files has 
     changed a little.  An example of the new structure is provided in 
     quartz.properties and konakart_jobs.xml.


Changes with KonaKart 6.3.0.0 - Released 20-Jun-2012
====================================================
  
  *) Added Shopping Widgets which can be introduced into social networks,
     blogs etc. with just a few lines of JavaScript.

  *) Added a new API call to request the version number of the KonaKart 
     engine.

  *) Issue a warning if the version of the Admin App is incompatible with 
     the version of the server.  (The behaviour associated with this check 
     can be customized by modifying the konakartadmin.compatibility.action
     configuration parameter in the konakartadmin_gwt.properties file).

  *) Renamed some of the default Shipping Module text properties to be more 
     meaningful.

  *) Added an Affiliate Id attribute to the order object.

  *) Added the JSONP protocol (JSON with padding) to provide a method to 
     request data from a server in a different domain. 

  *) Added a "return_by_api" attribute to the configuration parameters.  If 
     a configuration parameter has this attribute set to 0 (false), it will
     not be returned by the various getConfigurations() API calls on the 
     storefront engine.   This improves performance (as previously all 
     configurations were cached for each client session), reduces memory usage 
     and tightens security by allowing greater control over which parameters 
     are accessible through the engine.  See below for more details on the
     changes that might affect existing custom code that uses these interfaces
     to access configuration values.

  *) JSON server is now disabled by default.  To enable JSON move to the custom
     directory of the installation and execute the enable_JSON ANT target.

  *) Added the ability to make specified interfaces inaccessible via JSON. Set
     these interface names in the konakart web.xml as JSON servlet parameters
     - see the includedInterfaces and excludedInterfaces init-parameters.  This
     provides greater flexibility in defining which interfaces are made 
     available over JSON.

  *) The entries in the product type list box in the edit product panel of 
     the admin app can be excluded and ordered using file based configuration.
     A "Please Select" entry has been added for the cases where you want to 
     force the admin user to choose a product type rather than being able 
     to accept the default type.

  *) Added more custom validation parameters for XML_IO.
  
  *) Introduced the ability to use substitution variables in the Admin App
     Help messages which allows you to define repeated sections in one place
     and "include" them wherever you like.  This also allows Oracle and DB2 
     users (who had a 4000 byte limit on the size of these messages) to create
     messages of any length by splitting messages into smaller messages and 
     combining them in one message using substitution.  See the format for
     substitutions (${name}) in the help.editProductsDetails property as an
     example.

  *) Viewing of PDF invoices now possible from the storefront within Liferay

  *) Using File-based Connfiguration it is now possible to define the number
     of customers, orders, products and reviews returned in each group for
     display in the Admin App.

  *) Added a new API call to search for a customer's subscriptions.

  *) Modified Solr suggested search to use (configurable) a regex search on 
     the terms so that is doesn't only match the term string from the 
     beginning of the term.
  
  *) Added a config variable to set expungeDeletes="true" when doing a Solr 
     commit. When set, objects marked for deletion are removed from the index.
     This is important for suggested search since the Solr terms functionality
     returns documents that have been marked for deletion but not removed
     from the index.

  *) Increased the size of 5 columns in the database for storing CITY values.

Bug Fixes
---------

  *) Store front application was throwing an exception when using customer 
     tags and when the session expired.

  *) The JSON API wasn't encoding all characters correctly.

  *) Repeat order was throwing an exception when using a shipping module
     that returns multiple quotes.

  *) Category Shared indicator now passed correctly to getPdf and DisplayFile
     servlets.  Previously it was not passed at all which meant these would
     always use the default of categories not shared.

  *) tick.gif, cross.gif images added to konakart/images for use in velocity
     templates when running as a portlet within Liferay

  *) Commidea payment module was not setting the ProcessingDB on all requests.

Backwards Compatibility Alert
-----------------------------

  *) The JSON Server has become an Enterprise-Only feature.
  
  *) Configuration parameters now have a new "return_by_api" attribute.  To 
     return the value of a configuration parameter through the storefront API
     (KKEngIf) you need to set the return_by_api column to 1 (true).  By
     default the return_by_api value will be 0 (false).  Therefore, you will
     need to set these values to 1 (true) if you need to access them using the
     various getConfiguration() API calls on the storefront API (KKEngIf). The
     database upgrade scripts for the 6.3.0.0 release set the "return_by_api"
     attribute to 1 (true) for all configuration parameters in a defined set of
     configuration groups (see upgrade scripts for details) which in the default 
     installation are required by the storefront to function correctly.  You 
     should review the configuration parameters that are returned by the APIs
     for suitability in your system. The Admin App has been modified to allow
     you to set the "return_by_api" setting for each configuration parameter.
     It is recommended to set "return_by_api" to 0 (false) wherever possible to
     maximize performance, minimize memory usage and tighten security.

  *) The editConfiguration() API call on KKEngIf has been deprecated but has
     also been modified to return a KKException in all cases.   You should use 
     the Administration APIs (defined in KKAdminIf) to modify configuration
     parameters.


Changes with KonaKart 6.2.0.0 - Released 19-Apr-2012
====================================================

  *) Added a new View Logs Panel to the Admin App to allow an 
     authorised Administrator to view the files in the log directory.

  *) Improved expressions with the addition of an AGE_TYPE customer
     tag. Allows you act on the  elapsed time (or age) of an event. 
     i.e. To store the date of the last login for the customer
     so you can take action if a customer hasn't logged in for two 
     weeks. Alternatively you could store the age of a customer 
     to offer promotions to certain age brackets.

  *) Added a warning to the Promotions Panel in the Admin App
     to warn when the module for a selected promotion hasn't
     been installed yet.

  *) Database modification to allow entry_firstname and entry_lastname
     columns of the address_book table to contain null values.

  *) New kk_config table to record miscellaneous system characteristics
     such as database version and type.   Read-Only access to this 
     table is available via new API calls (hence this could be used to
     store miscellaneous custom data that has a "Key" and a "Value").
     Note that these are global values and not per store if running in a 
     multi-store mode.

  *) Exception messages populated with KonaKart version number to 
     provide additional information to aid with diagnosing problems.

  *) Added buttons to Reviews Panel in the Admin App to enable the
     selection of the product and the customer who wrote the review.
     
  *) A new updated_by_id column has been added to the 
     orders_status_history table to record the user who made the change 
     to the order status.  New APIs have been added to allow you to 
     specify this new Id on order status changes - see the new
     updateOrder API.

  *) Added option to not calculate the quantity of a bundle product 
     based on the quantities of the bundled products. The option also
     applies when updating the inventory.  

  *) On the Customers Panel of the Admin App it is now possible to search
     for customers by customer Id, first name, and email address.

  *) Introduced a new Commidea Vanguard Payment module

  *) Added an animated gif to credit card entry panel to stop customers
     clicking the submit button multiple times.


Bug Fixes
---------

  *) Avoided some null exceptions occurring when displaying products 
     with null names and descriptions.

  *) Avoided some null exceptions occurring when not finding SSO tokens
     for specified secret keys.
  
  *) Admin App panels when using Internet Explorer were not displaying 
     the hour and minute drop lists properly when selecting a date.

  *) Removed spurious characters that appeared when switching from the
     rich text editor to the plain text editor of the Admin App when
     using certain browsers. Firefox and Chrome injected a break tag 
     and IE injected a non-breaking space within a paragraph tag.

  *) Modified the OrderTotalDiscount promotion module to reduce the 
     tax when calculating a discount on the pre-tax total of an order.


Changes with KonaKart 6.1.0.0 - Released 13-Mar-2012
====================================================

  *) Improved recurring billing functionality and documentation. 
     Implemented all payment gateway calls for AuthorizeNet to 
     insert, update and cancel a subscription.
  
  *) Added a new mode: Shared Category mode which is valid only when
     sharing products and customers.

  *) Added an Admin API call to copy products between store when in 
     shared category mode.

  *) New feature for analysing the performance of the storefront APIs.
     Useful as a starting point for overall performance analysis.

  *) Added some logging options to allow logging changes to be made and 
     take effect without the need to restart.

  *) Upgraded to BIRT 3.7.2

  *) Added a batch job to synchronize stores when in shared category 
     mode. This allows you to have a pre-production store and a 
     production store. 

  *) Added an Admin App panel to synchronize products between stores.

  *) Allow the use of a text entry field rather than a droplist for specifying
     the store to log in to when in Multi-Store mode in the Admin App.

  *) Now possible to view the Admin App using a language that is for 
     display-only purposes where entities such as products & categories do
     not need a translation defined for this language.  (Previously it was
     necessary to provide translations for all languages for the entities
     that have language variants).

  *) Added a KKServletContextListener to manage the shutdown of miscellaneous
     threads to avoid memory leaks.  To enable this ensure that this <listener>
     section in the web.xml is uncommented (it is uncommented by default).

Bug Fixes
---------

  *) When in shared products mode edit product had a bug whereby if more
     than one category was changed in one edit API call, only the first
     link in the product_to_category table was saved with the storeId.
     The other links were saved with a null storeId.
  
  *) Added fix to ConfigCacheUpdater when in multi store shared db mode
     to only return enabled stores. In some cases it would try (only once)
     to refresh the caches of stores that weren't enabled.

  *) Added fix to EngineConfigCacheUpdater to terminate its thread after 5
     consecutive exceptions.  Under certain circumstances this thread was
     not terminating even after the rest of KonaKart was stopped.

  *) When inserting and editing products, the external prices and quantities
     were being set outside of the main transaction.

  *) When searching for products in the admin app using the SKU, the default
     wildcard search settings weren't being used.

  *) When in multi-store shared products mode the admin app was displaying
     reviews for all products even if they weren't present in the store.

  *) When in multi-store shared products mode the admin app was displaying
     miscellaneous items for all products even if they weren't present in 
     the store.

  *) Subscriptions panel in the admin app was throwing an internal exception 
     when subscriptions were inserted with a null trial amount value.

  *) Added scale to a divide in the TaxMgr which was throwing an exception
     when external prices were being set in the basket not divisible by the
     quantity of products present.


Changes with KonaKart 6.0.0.0 - Released 1-Jan-2012
===================================================

  *) Improved the KonaKart promotion subsystem (Enterprise only) by adding 
     functionality to evaluate promotions on individual products rather 
     than as Order Totals. This means that a customer can now visualize 
     the details of active promotions for a product before adding it to 
     the cart. 

  *) Added functionality to support product options with variable quantity.
     (Enterprise Only) i.e. Customer can choose number of GigaBytes of 
     extra memory by entering an amount rather than choosing a fixed option.    
  
  *) The object containing payment gateway callback information has been 
     given some extra attributes so that more information can be stored
     regarding the transaction type, transaction amount and custom 
     information.

  *) Added a new enableCustomer() API call and struts action to call it.
     This method can be used to verify a customer's email before enabling him. 

  *) Added some custom relationship types in the Admin App for setting up 
     product to product relationships. 

  *) Added animated gif to GWT one page checkout code to show customers
     that the system is waiting for data to arrive. Useful for the case when
     interfacing with external shipping or tax systems that may take a few
     seconds to respond.

  *) Upgraded to new version of jTDS (v1.2.5) - for details of changes see 
     http://jtds.sourceforge.net/

  *) Upgraded to new versions of avalon-framework-api (v4.3), 
     commons-collections (v3.2), commons-configuration (v1.7), 
     commons-logging (v1.1), jcs (v1.3) and downgraded commons-pool (v1.3).

  *) Upgraded to new version of Torque (v3.3) and Village (v3.3).

  *) Remove the limit of displaying only 1000 Admin Users in the panel where
     the users are given roles. 

  *) Product Option and Option Value names have been given a max size of 64
     characters and the validation length through the admin app is now
     configurable.

  *) Added KK Engine API call, getAllPromotions(), to return all active
     promotions. 

  *) Made the Enterprise Extensions installer more robust when installing to 
     Community Edition systems with non-default data present.

  *) Added a new SQL Analysis utility (Enterprise Only) that can provide a 
     quick overview of the SQL performance of the system.

  *) Added Online Help for Reports Configuration in the Admin App.
  
  *) When deleting a GeoZone (or "Tax Area") using the deleteGeoZone() Admin 
     API call, in order to maintain data integrity, any tax rates that use the 
     specified geoZone are also deleted.
  
  *) In the Admin App the date template is now read from the message catalog
     so that different languages can have different templates. Some of the dates
     are now shown with hour:minute precision.

  *) Ability to define the default value for and/or hide the "Requires Coupon" 
     checkbox on the Promotions panel of the Admin App using File-Based 
     Configuration.

Bug Fixes
---------

  *) Save button sometimes enabled at wrong times on Tax Classes Panel of the
     Admin App.  A minor usability improvement.

  *) Fixed bug that allowed checkout without selecting a shipping method 
     when using the JSP checkout screens.
  
  *) Fixed a SOLR related problem in multi-store shared products mode. When 
     editing a product for one store, the categories of the product in other
     stores were being corrupted in SOLR.


Changes with KonaKart 5.8.0.0 - Released 08-Dec-2011
====================================================

  *) Introduction of a jQuery plugin enabling you to call the KK storefront 
     API from JavaScript AJAX calls. The plugin uses the JSON APIs which are
     now available in the community version. Documentation available under 
     the doc directory after installation.

  *) Added possibility to perform faceted product searches using SOLR. The facet 
     attributes can be defined for different types of products using the custom 
     attribute functionality.

  *) "Miscellaneous Items", with defined "Miscellaneous Item Types" can now be 
     associated with products and categories.

  *) Added 5 custom fields to the EmailOptions objects to provide greater
     flexibility in customizing the generation of email messages.

  *) New CyberSource Hosted Order Post Payment Gateway Module.

  *) Now bundled with Apache Tomcat 7.0.22 (previously bundled with 6.0.33).
     Note that this version of tomcat requires a minimum Java version of 1.6.

  *) A new utility to create encrypted database passwords for the properties 
     files so that they don't have to be stored in plain text. (Enterprise 
     Extensions only).

  *) A security feature has been added for the BIRT Viewer.  By default this
     is enabled.  With this enabled it is now essential to have a valid 
     sessionId in order to execute a report using the BIRT viewer.

  *) Upgraded two apache-commons jars (to dbcp-1.4.jar and pool-1.4.jar). These
     provide various bug-fixes and improved JDBC support.

  *) Upgraded to allow the hiding of the Edit button on the Orders panel via 
     role-based security.

  *) Allow the use of a CLOB for the custom attributes column in Oracle so
     that more than 4000 characters can be used for custom attributes if 
     required.

  *) Modified the order panel of the Admin App to resize automatically to 
     fit lower resolution displays.

  *) Replaced unmappable characters from CyberSource java files so that they
     can be compiled without warnings on platforms where UTF8 is the default
     encoding.

  *) Added the option to hide the Print button on the Order Invoice Panel
     of the Admin App (using file-based configuration).
 
  *) Now possible to rename the default store from "store1" to another name.
     This is still not recommended practice but possible if required.

  *) Upload button moved to a new position to allow the Manufacturer's panel
     of the Admin App to fit on a smaller screen.

  *) Centred Admin App dialog boxes using a different technique to place them 
     in more central positions on all platforms.

  *) Added functionality to the storefront app in order to facilitate SSO 
     by passing customer and session information in a secure way when moving 
     between two different applications using the same engine. i.e. A CMS system
     to place products in the cart and another system to checkout. 
  
  *) When inserting a product using the admin app, you can now specify hour:minute
     precision for the available and expiry dates.

  *) When inserting a promotion using the admin app, you can now specify hour:minute
     precision for the start and end dates.

  *) The select manufacturer and select template dialog boxes in the admin app 
     have been given a double click handler to make a selection. 
    
  *) Added functionality in the Admin App to facilitate the maintenance of custom
     attributes. When custom attribute descriptions are modified or deleted, 
     there is now the option to automatically update all of the products using
     the custom attribute. 

  *) Added last modified date as a search constraint for products in the Admin
     App API.

  *) Added File Based Configuration parameters to the Admin App to make the 
     title of the Edit Product panel configurable. You can now decide whether 
     to show the product name, SKU or both.

  *) Added a File Based Configuration parameter to the Admin App to make the 
     Products panel configurable. You can now decide whether to show
     the product name or SKU in the first column of the array.

  *) Added a RichText custom field widget to facilitate data entry for 
     template based custom fields containing lines of text.
  
  *) Added an API call to the storefront API to check whether a coupon
     exists and whether it is active.

  *) Digital Downloads shipping module now installed by default.


Bug Fixes
---------

  *) Modified EditAddrBody.jsp to fix bug whereby phone numbers weren't
     being displayed and therefore lost when the address was edited. 

  *) When the Admin App is deployed to a webapp with a different name the
     PDF viewer failed because it was hard-coded to use "/konakartadmin".  
     The Admin App code now derives the webapp name dynamically.

  *) Due to changes in the default treatment of escaped strings in PostgreSQL
     9.1 the syntax in the database loading scripts (konakart_demo.sql etc)
     has been modified.  Previously the regular expression loaded for the
     sample custom attribute for date recognition was being imported 
     incorrectly into PostgreSQL 9.1.  For users of earlier versions of 
     KonaKart, this can be fixed by running the database upgrade scripts.

  *) In the Admin App, invisible products weren't being displayed after 
     having been added as a merchandising link (up sell, cross sell etc.)
     or as a promotion rule.

  *) A race condition has been fixed which sometimes caused the deletion
     of all merchandising links (i.e. Up Sell) to a product when only 
     attempting to delete one.

  *) When a product is saved, the merchandising drop list in the 
     merchandising panel, no longer resets to "Up Sell". It keeps
     the current selection.

  *) The Category panel in the Admin App wasn't counting invisible products
     in the number of products per category.

  *) Modified encoding for the directory structure SEO URLs in order to 
     remove encoded forward and backward slashes which are not allowed
     by some app servers for security reasons. Any forward and backward
     slashes in product, manufacturer or category names are converted to
     dashes "-" in the SEO URL.

  *) Increased the size of the products_name attribute in the orders_products
     table to 256 to match the products_name in the products_description
     table.

  *) Updated MyProductMgr.java (in apiexamples) to reflect the latest
     method signatures.

  *) Fixed admin app bug when viewing products for manufacturers. The 
     manufacturer constraint wasn't being set properly when filtering
     the search results with more constraints.

  *) The formatting of hour:minute in the edit product panel of the Admin
     App has been modified to always show two digits for hour and two for 
     minute. The modification affects the definition of special price start 
     and end dates as well as bookable product time slots.

  *) The option to delete products when deleting a manufacturer or a category,
     wasn't deleting invisible products.

Backwards Compatibility Alert
-----------------------------

  *) With the introduction of tomcat 7 there is now a requirement to use a 
     minimum java version of 1.6 (previously we supported Java 1.5 and above).

  *) The JSON APIs are now "switched on" after a default installation. The 
     web.xml file of the konakart webapp must be edited in order to disable
     them.


Changes with KonaKart 5.7.5.0 - Released 13-Oct-2011
====================================================

  *) SOLR searches now return facets for categories and manufacturers
     so that the search results can be filtered using this information.

  *) Enhanced product search to enable searching for products in multiple
     categories and for multiple manufacturers.

  *) Added a new mode for formatting URLs for SEO. The standard format
     for URLs is now a directory structure containing the SEO data
     rather than extra attributes.

  *) Provide access by default to the Velocity EscapeTool to escape output
     from your Velocity templates (for emails, orders etc).  

  *) Improved functionality of the getRelatedProductsWithOptions()
     API call of the Application Engine. The improvement is to allow 
     to invert the direction of the related product link. This is 
     especially useful for bundled products, so rather than discovering
     the products within a bundle, you can determine which bundles a 
     product belongs to. 

  *) Automatic redirect to konakart webapp when the http://localhost:8780/ is
     used.

  *) Upgrade of SOLR. KonaKart is now shipped with SOLR 3.4.0.

  *) Modified updateOrderStatus() API call of Admin App to allow status change
     using the same status.

  *) Enterprise Source pack now places the relevant Enterprise-only source 
     files under the custom directory for easier custom ANT building.

  *) Include the import and export of product tags in the XML_IO utility.
  
  *) Allow the definition of translations of module names so that they can be 
     viewed in the currently-selected language in the Admin App.

  *) Drop lists for promotion types and order statuses are now populated with
     entries in the currently-selected language in the Admin App.

  *) Increased the size of the category name to 256 characters.
  
  *) Provide more flexibility in defining localisations with the introduction 
     of several new Admin App message properties that can be defined for
     each language.


Bug Fixes
---------

  *) The GetBestSellers API call of the App Engine wasn't returning the special
     price of a product.
  
  *) Allow more than one store to be cloned at the same time.

  *) Admin App fix to prevent Administrators accessing the kk_store records
     of stores they are not authorised to access.

  *) Fix for the Admin App when installing the LDAP module on Oracle when it is
     the only "Other" module installed.

  *) Fixed encoding problem when uploading images from the admin app with 
     double byte character names. The name of the image on the file system 
     wasn't being set correctly.

  *) When registering / checking out using the one page checkout GWT code
     the default country in the drop list was not being set to the store 
     country in some browsers. 
 
  
Changes with KonaKart 5.7.0.0 - Released 13-Sep-2011
====================================================

  *) New CyberSource Payment gateway

  *) New WorldPay XML Redirect Payment gateway

  *) New Free Gift Order Total Module. 

  *) Added custom fields to order totals.

  *) Now bundled with Apache Tomcat 6.0.33 (previously bundled with 6.0.18)

  *) Changes some struts action classes to do a 301 redirect rather than 302
     when adding SEO data to the URLs. 

  *) Added an attribute to Order to keep track of who created the order.
     It is automatically set when logging in to the storefront app as 
     an admin user and creating an order.

  *) Use version number in GWT nocache.js files to ensure GWT applications
     (Admin App and components in the Storefront) are updated by browsers 
     after upgrading to new versions.

  *) Ability to define the default value for and/or hide the "Use Customer 
     Language" checkbox on the Customer Communications panel of the Admin 
     App using File-Based Configuration.

  *) Modified testDB() API call of Admin App to not return the database connection
     string and database user. The API call remains backwards compatible but only
     returns information to determine whether a DB connection can be made.

  *) If present, use the Order Number for the Invoice Filename rather than
     the internal Order Id.

Bug Fixes
---------

  *) One page checkout new customer registration fixed

  *) Engine was throwing an exception when retrieving a wish list for a
     temporary customer containing a disabled or nonexistent product.

  *) Change language wasn't working properly for the admin app when 
     running within a Liferay Portlet.
  
  
Changes with KonaKart 5.6.0.0 - Released 24-Aug-2011
====================================================

  *) LDAP module to connect to an LDAP directory in order to validate
     customer and admin user credentials.

  *) In Admin app can now search for orders based on customer name, 
     email and postcode in order to search for orders for non 
     registered customers.

  *) Added the ability to add custom business objects to the Velocity context
     to make these available for your Velocity templates.

Bug Fixes
---------

  *) Fixed bug when inserting coupons using the admin app. The times_used 
     attribute was getting set to the value of the coupon selected
     before the insert.

  *) In the TaxAreaMapping panel of the Admin App, the Search and Clear buttons
     were overlapping the border of the search panel in Chrome and FireFox.

  *) Wrapped the manufacturer name in CDATA when sending a product to the 
     SOLR search engine to avoid having to encode certain characters within
     the manufacturer name such as the ampersand character.

  *) Fixed bug in multi-store non shared customers mode. In some cases the 
     categories weren't being displayed in the categories tab of the 
     edit product panel.

  *) The Change Language functionality of the admin app wasn't working 
     correctly when the file based configuration property was set so that
     the password is never stored in a temporary cookie.

  *) A fix for the "controversial" new deferred segment creation feature 
     introduced into Oracle 11gR2 (Enterprise Only).  Installations failed 
     with this db with the default setting of DEFERRED_SEGMENT_CREATION=TRUE.
     Now our Oracle scripts set DEFERRED_SEGMENT_CREATION=FALSE on the session
     to ensure that the installation runs as required.


Changes with KonaKart 5.5.0.0 - Released 02-Aug-2011
====================================================

  *) Introduced Bookable Products functionality to cater for products such 
     as courses.

  *) Added functionality to the admin app to allow you to manage catalog prices
     and quantities. 

  *) Added an "Active" attribute to the Country objects allowing you to mark
     countries as "Active" or "Inactive".
  
  *) Repeat Order functionality of the storefront application now repeats
     the billing and delivery addresses rather than just presenting the 
     default ones.

  *) Made the product type search droplist (Admin App Products Panel) configurable 
     using the Hidden Product Types configuration variable.

  *) New Payment Gateways Added:  Barclaycard SmartPay Hosted and Barclaycard 
     SmartPay API (both with 3D-Secure capability).

  *) The "sessionId" parameter has been added to the URL when reports are run
     from the Reports panel of the Admin App.   This allows you to authenticate 
     the user by checking the sessionId (this is the KonaKart SessionId).  The 
     sessionId has also been added to the "Status Page Report URL" that is displayed
     in a frame on the "My Store Status Panel".

  *) In the product listing view of the Admin App only show the special price if
     it is enabled.
  
  *) In the Returned Products panel of the Admin App, a new Return can now be
     inserted by entering the order number rather than the order id. 
     
Bug Fixes
---------

  *) Added Order by Rating constraints to Solr mgr.

  *) Fixed a bug in the XML_IO utility where a property was referred to as 
     "mesaages" rather than "messages".

  *) Calendar Pop-up bug fixed where the wrong date was being selected (when 31/5/2011
     was clicked on, 1/5/2011 was actually selected).

  *) Fixed a bug where in the admin app where the image servlet url was hard 
     coded when uploading manufacturer and category images.
  
  *) Fixed a bug in the admin app where sorting products by price was
     generating an exception when using MS SQL.

  *) The tep_cfg_pull_down_order_statuses( set_function wasn't working properly in
     every store in multi-store mode with non-shared customers.  This bug caused
     order status droplists to be empty in some of the stores. Now fixed.

  *) Fixed a start-up race condition where configuration variables could be
     accessed before they were initialised.

  *) When the admin app was integrated with Liferay and the KonaKart session 
     was timing out before the Liferay session, an exception was being thrown. 

  *) Installer defaulted to mysql when installing the Enterprise Extensions in
     engine Mode 1 (multi-store multi-datbase mode).   Now the wizard presents
     a database type choice to allow the user to override this default.


Changes with KonaKart 5.4.0.0 - Released 20-May-2011
====================================================

  *) Suggested Search. As you type into the search box, a list of suggested
     search items appear matching the typed letters. The suggestions are 
     weighted by popularity so the most common suggestions are shown
     first. (Enterprise Only)

  *) JSON version of the KonaKart application engine (another implementation 
     of the KKEngIf interface).  This allows you to use JSON calls from your
     storefront application for ALL KonaKart storefront functionality - useful 
     for many purposes including improving performance over limited-bandwidth 
     networks and for use on mobile devices. (Enterprise Only)
  
  *) Integration with TaxCloud (taxcloud.net) Sales Tax Management System.

  *) A panel has been added to the storefront application to show 
     recently viewed products.

  *) In multi-store shared products mode, a product now has 3 custom fields 
     that may contain store related data. i.e. The data they contain can be
     different depending on the store.
  
  *) Added code in the storefront app to change session when switching to 
     HTTPS to avoid session hijacking.

  *) Modified the application Register Customer API call to allow to register 
     customers in a disabled state.
  
  *) Made the text on the Delete Product Dialog Internationalizable through
     the AdminMessages.properties files.

  *) Extended the products_name column in the products_description table from 
     64 to 256 characters

  *) Wherever the Rich Text Editor is used within the Admin App, the mode
     can be toggled from Rich Text to Plain Text.

  *) Changed some dynamically created labels in the promotion rules panel 
     which were not being generated correctly. 

  *) Dynamic reloading of logging settings (now you can change the active 
     log settings without having to restart tomcat).
     
  *) New properties file variable to set the timeout value for the KonaKart 
     Admin web services.
  
  *) Modified storefront one page checkout GWT code to handle session 
     timeouts gracefully without throwing an exception.

  *) Following Google's decision to retire the Google Base APIs (as from
     1st June 2011), these have been replaced by the Google Shopping Content 
     APIs for publishing products to Google.
 
  *) Upgraded to Google GWT 2.3.0 - includes support for Internet Explorer 9
  
  *) Complete javadoc provided for client engine, server engine and admin

  *) Syntax errors fixed in the service.bat file for setting up KonaKart as
     a Windows Service.

  *) Allow the definition of the height of the Custom Panels in the 
     Admin App

  *) Allow the access to the Reviews & Addresses buttons on the Customers 
     panel (and on the Customer Orders panel) to be controlled using 
     role-based security.

  *) Allow the access to the Reviews & Addresses buttons on the Product 
     panel to be controlled using role-based security.

  *) Allow the access to the Coupons & Gift Certificates buttons on the 
     Promotions panel to be controlled using role-based security.

  *) Privileges panel used for defining role-based security now allows access
     to all 5 Custom fields rather than just 3.

  *) Modified the way you change the logo displayed at the top left corner 
     of the Admin App.  Now you just place your own logo in a file called 
     logo.jpg in the konakartadmin webapp, replacing the existing logo.jpg.

  *) Promotion rules weren't working for categories when a product was in 
     multiple categories. The product was sometimes not being found 
     depending on which category was searched first.

  *) # products per category not always calculated correctly when in 
     multi store shared products mode and products have been excluded
     from a store.

Changes with KonaKart 5.3.0.1 - Released 10-Mar-2011
====================================================

  *) Fix to a problem when in Multi-Store non-shared products mode where
     the correct language Id is not found when trying to access templates
     from the Admin App

  *) Fix for a bug that occurs when products with options are added to a 
     promotion rule or gift certificates with options are added to a 
     promotion. The problem occurs not when adding but when re-reading 
     the products that have been added. At this point the option value 
     name and option name are null.

  *) Fix for a race condition when viewing subscriptions from the admin
     app. Sometimes, the popup waiting dialog never closes when the data
     appears from the database.

Changes with KonaKart 5.3.0.0 - Released 07-Mar-2011
====================================================

New Features
------------
  
  *) MQ Integration - Apache ActiveMQ is integrated as an embedded Java Message 
     Queue (Enterprise Extensions only).
 
  *) Custom Attributes. A product can now be given an unlimited number of custom
     attributes based on a template that can be assigned to a product. Each 
     attribute has metadata to enforce validation and choose the widget during 
     the insert process (using the admin app) and to format the data correctly
     in the storefront application (Enterprise Extensions only).
  
  *) Added a Rich Text Editor to the Customer Communications Panel in the 
     Admin App.
 
  *) Now possible to display the list of countries in the language of the chosen 
     locale rather than just the language used for the names in the countries
     table.
  
  *) Data Integrity Checker extended to correct any lack of integrity in Order 
     Status data.  (Previously the coverage was only for Customer Groups).  It 
     automatically "repairs" the database by adding missing language records for
     Customer Groups and Order Statuses.

  *) Added customer preferences to storefront app to allow a customer to choose
     the page size when paging through lists of products, reviews and orders.	 	 

  *) Upgraded to Google GWT 2.2.0

  *) Added customer events that can be used for reporting purposes. They all get
     written into a database table that can be in a different DB so as not to
     impact performance. Events can be used to track things such as customers
     visiting, logging in, viewing products, removing products from cart, 
     confirming orders etc. 

  *) Allow addition of an attachment for the following eMail API calls:
     -sendTemplateEmailToCustomer1()
     -sendWelcomeEmail1()
     -sendNewPassword1()
 
  *) Added an invisible attribute to Customers to allow them to be hidden.
 
  *) Allow the use of CLOBs for product descriptions when using Oracle.
  
  *) Update to PayPal PayflowPro payment gateway to add VENDOR and PARTNER
     as configurable parameters.  (If you are upgrading from a previous 
     version and using PayflowPro you will need to first uninstall this 
     payment module (in the Admin App) then re-install it after the upgrade
     to expose the new configuration parameters).
  
  *) Added API call to admin engine to call a payment module. An AuthorizeNet
     Admin App module has also been added. This API call can be used for any
     payment module transaction such as authorizing payment when products are
     shipped and for recurring billing transactions.

  *) Added the ability to switch dynamically between the Rich Text Editor 
     and the Plain text editor on the Messages Panel of the Admin App.

Bug Fixes-App
-------------

  *) When doing a product search, the total number of products returned was 
     counting products multiple times when they were under more than one 
     category. 


Changes with KonaKart 5.2.0.0 - Released 15-Jan-2011
====================================================

New Features
------------
  
  *) New "Buy X Get Y Free" Order Total Module

  *) New "Pick up in Store" Shipping Module

  *) Added drop shipper support by associating addresses to products.
     Manufacturers can also now have multiple addresses. The Admin App
     has been enhanced to manage multiple addresses for Customers,
     Products and Manufacturers.

  *) Modified Order Total object to accommodate an array of order totals.
     This allows each product discount to have its own line item in the
     order. i.e. An order total module may return an array of results.

  *) Added invisible attribute and search field to a zone object. Also
     added functionality to allow to set the zone during registration
     and address change. Changes should allow better handling of the cases
     where a US state contains multiple tax zones.

  *) Added custom fields to the digital download object and app API calls
     to get and edit an object. 

  *) Added functionality to update store front message catalogs when a 
     refresh cache command is sent from the admin app. When upgrading,
     a change must be made to the struts-config.xml to enable this 
     functionality. 
 
  *) Added a multi-lingual description field to the category object.
  
  *) Added possibility of creating a wish list even when not logged in.
  
  *) Added possibility of limiting the number of times a promotion is
     used by a customer.
  
  *) The getProduct() API call of the app engine now returns an array
     of ProductQuantity objects for each product which contain the
     SKU for the product variation as well as quantity in stock 
     information.
  
  *) Added a new method to the Shipping Module Interface designed for 
     the purpose of integrating KonaKart with 3rd Party Shipping 
     Applications.  An example is provided for UPS WorldShip which uses
     the Auto-Import feature to import Orders from KonaKart.
 
  *) When creating a new store dynamically using "Clone Store" in the 
     Admin App a check is made (in the background) that the new store 
     name chosen does not already exist.
 
  *) New exportOrder API call for exporting orders in various ways 
     which can be specified in an options parameter.  One option is to
     export the full order as XML.
  
  *) Now possible to specify which product types will appear on the 
     product types droplist on the edit product panel of the Admin App.
     This is done by defining which product types you wish to hide in a new
     configuration variable on the 'Admin App Configuration' panel.
 
  *) A small number of configuration parameters have been moved to
     different sections to arrange them in more logical groups.
 
  *) Dialog displaying error messages in the Admin App now uses a vertical
     scrollbar making it easier to view very long exception messages.

  *) Added product quantity as a criteria to the product search object.

  *) Each server engine instance now has a thread for refreshing cached
     data. Previously the refresh API call was made from the client engine
     and so this functionality wasn't available when the client engine
     wasn't deployed.

  *) Added extra hooks to the KKAppEng to intercept when the config variables
     are cached and when the temporary data caches are refreshed. 

  *) New Admin App API calls to set / get product prices in external table to  
     support multiple catalogs.

  *) New Admin App and App API calls to set / get product quantity in external 
     table to support multiple catalogs.
 
  *) Upgraded the KonaKart installer to version 1.2.15 of InstallJammer see
     http://www.installjammer.com/docs/index.html?ReleaseNotes for details.
 
  *) New set of getConfigurationValue(key) API calls for KKEngIf that get the 
     configuration value for the specified key (get as Integer, Bool, etc).
 
  *) Better error reporting when configuration variables cannot be converted 
     into integers or decimal values - resolves start-up problems which could 
     result with mis-configured Shipping modules.
  
  *) Added page links to page through products in the store front application.
     Previously paging was only possible using Next and Previous links.

  *) Added image upload buttons to Category and Manufacturer panels in the Admin 
     App.

  *) Added a review maintenance panel to the Admin App and Review States to allow
     reviews to be approved before being published.

  *) Now possible to store the application messages in the database or in the 
     current messsage properties files (which remains the default).   New kkMessages 
     utility provided to load messages from message properties files into the
     database.  New Admin App "Messages" panel added for the live maintenance of
     this messages.	 See User Guide for details.
 
  *) A number of improvements in the handling of files used in the system with 
     respect to correct use of file encoding.

  *) Extracted the KonaKart logo from the previous image resource bundle to make it
     easier to add your own company logo to the Admin App.

  *) Modified the admin app to add paging for manufacturers and product options
     in order to better support large product catalogs.

  *) Upgraded to BIRT 2.6.1

  *) Data Integrity Checker utility introduced to correct any lack of integrity in 
     Customer Groups data.  It automatically "repairs" the database by adding 
     missing language records for Customer Groups.
 
 
Bug Fixes-Admin App
------------------- 

  *) Tree view of ProductOptionsPanel now remains open on the node edited 
     or inserted.
 
  *) Templates used to display invoices, packing slips etc are now selected based
     on the currently-selected language of the Admin App rather than the default
     language of the store.

  *) Panels for setting product quantity and availability date were not working
     when product was invisible.
 
  *) Translation of labels and floatover text now possible for the non-standard
     Pomotion-Type-specific configuration fields.   This only affected a small
     number of promotion configuration fields.
 
  *) Clone Store operation checks supplied credentials before commencing
     the creation of a new store preventing the creation of partially-completed 
     stores.
 
  *) Transaction errors did not cause rollbacks in all circumstances when saving
     customer objects in the Admin engine.

  *) Some panels were never showing invisible products regardless of the setting
     of the configuration variable.

  *) Entry in specials table wasn't getting deleted when the product was deleted.
  
  *) Admin App panel for configuring bundled products wasn't working correctly 
     when one of the bundled products was itself a bundle.

  *) Problem displaying invoices from stores other than store1 in multi-store 
     configuration.

 
Bug Fixes-App
-------------

  *) Some promotion modules weren't applying the rule properly for applying
     the promotion only after a minimum number of products are ordered.
  
  *) Sort by "times ordered" was not implemented for SOLR searches.

  *) All of the modules (shipping, payment, promotion) have been made multi-store
     ready. Previously they shared some static variables which didn't allow each
     store to set them independently.

  *) Wish list management wasn't functioning correctly when products were being
     added using the store front application in different languages.

  *) If all categories had last modified date set to null, the category tree 
     cache was never used, so reducing performance.

  *) When using external prices, the option prices were never being shown as 
     negative.

Bug Fixes XML_IO Importer / Exporter 
------------------------------------

  *) Configuration Parameters no longer lose their sort order attributes
     when exporting

  *) Fixed a null pointer exception that occured if wishlists with no items
     were imported  



Changes with KonaKart 5.1.0.0 - Released 09-Aug-2010
====================================================

New Features
------------
  
  *) RMI version of the KonaKart engines added.  Now there are three engine types: 
     direct java, SOAP Web Services and now RMI.

  *) Payflow Pro payment gateway

  *) Tiered pricing to apply discounts based on quantity ordered. The discount may be 
     defined as a price or as a percentage.

  *) Concentrated all tax calculations in a class for which source code is provided so 
     that the algorithm may be easily changed to match rules of different tax
     jurisdictions.
  
  *) Added a special price start date so that now both the start and expiry dates for
     a special offer may be programmed.
  
  *) Allow special price start date, end date and status to be read from the product object.
  
  *) Added a customer notification attribute to each order status so that when the status
     of an order is changed through the admin app, the notify customer checkbox is 
     automatically set to the value defined by the status. 

  *) By default Velocity logging is directed to the tomcat log rather than to a file
     called velocity.log in the current directory.
  
  *) Made the client engine API call getStoreId(), public so that it can be called
     from JSPs.
    
  *) Custom Validation enhanced for the Admin App to include a wider selection of attributes.
  
  *) Allow the decimal places of prices entered in the admin app to be set by a
     configuration variable. Previous to this they were set automatically based on the 
     number of decimal places supported by the currency.
  
  *) Added new Quartz - KonaKart bridge class that makes it easy to run any batch job in a 
     loop - once for every enabled store in a multi-store environment.

  *) Allow the price to be defined when a product is added to the cart rather than picking
     up the price from the product object or from an external catalog.

  *) Added a new street address attribute to the customer address object.
  
  *) Added custom fields to product options, product option values and product attributes.
  
  *) Added a configuration option that enables a warning to be shown if a duplicate SKU
     is found when editing or inserting a product in the Admin App.

  *) ANT target provided to create an Eclipse project for developing the storefront 
     application.


Bug Fixes-Admin App
------------------- 

  *) Made the labels on the "My Store Status" Panel display in the selected language rather 
     than the store's default language.

  *) Save/Cancel buttons now enabled correctly now when tax rate droplists are modified.


Bug Fixes-App
-------------

  *) Fixed DownloadInvoiceAction to remove java.lang.IllegalStateException: 
     getOutputStream() has already been called for this response when
     downloading a PDF file.
  
  *) Fixed DownloadInvoiceAction & AdminEngineMgr to function correctly when the engine is
     being reached through the SOAP APIs.
  
  *) Modified MainLayout.jsp to avoid Cannot find bean: "konakartKey" in 
     any scope exception caused by crawlers.

  *) Null check added to Zones shipping module to prevent null exception if 
     zone countries configuration value becomes null.

  *) New custom fields added in ver 5 (custom 6 - 10, 1-2Dec, 1-2Int) weren't
     getting reset in the resetCustomSearchFields() private method of the 
     application productMgr.

  *) The automatic deletion of expired gift certificates wasn't being managed
     properly when a customer had more than 1 certificate belonging to the same
     product id.
  
Backwards Compatibility Alert
-----------------------------
   
  *) By default KonaKart is now configured to use these ports in tomcat's server.xml file:
     Port             Old       New
     Server           8005      8785    Change to avoid clash with default tomcat port
     HTTP Connector   8780      8780    No change
     HTTPS Connector  8443      8783    Change to avoid clash with default tomcat port
     AJP Connector    8789      8789    No change 
     
     Note that the upgrade script modifies the HTTPS port configuration variable (called 
     'SSL_PORT_NUMBER') in the configuration table if and only if it is currently set to 8443 
     otherwise it remains unchanged.
     Also, the upgrade script modifies the ADMIN_APP_LOGIN_BASE_URL configuration variable in
     the configuration table to use the new HTTPS port but only if the value is currently the 
     default which is 'https://localhost:8443/konakart/AdminLoginSubmit.do' 


Changes with KonaKart 5.0.0.0 - Released 06-Jun-2010
====================================================

New Features
------------
  
  *) Reward point functionality has been added so that customers can be awarded points
     for buying products, registering, writing reviews etc. These points can be redeemed
     during the checkout process and a customer can view a statement of his recent 
     point transactions after logging in. An administrator can manage a customer's points.

  *) Support for recurring billing. Payment Schedule and Subscription objects have been
     introduced to support recurring billing natively using a KonaKart batch or through 
     a payment gateway that manages the billing process at regular intervals.
     
  *) Added a number of extra custom attributes to the product object including integers
     decimals. All fields can be used for searching and sorting. Expiry date has also
     been added.

  *) Added additional telephone number to customer. Added telephone and eMail to address.
     These attributes have been added to the address format template.

  *) The language of the store front application is saved in a cookie so that even non
     logged in customers return to the application in their preferred language. 
  
  *) Added a locale attribute to customers and orders to allow emails, especially from 
     the admin app to be sent out in the correct language.

  *) WYSIWYG editor added to the Admin App for editing product descriptions.

  *) Upgraded to Google GWT 2.0

  *) Added a refresh button to the reports panel of the Admin App
  
  *) If a logging properties file isn't found on the classpath, rather than giving a null exception,
     KonaKart now initialises the log4j system with a set of default logging properties. 
  
  *) Country objects returned by the getAllCountries() API call are now fully populated.

  *) Eclipse project supplied for customizing the One Page Checkout GWT code

  *) Now possible to set the first day of the week on the Calendar Popup widget.

  *) Made it possible to internationalise the few remaining aspects of the Admin App.
     To take advantage of these you will have to update your AdminMessages_XX.properties
     file for your own locales.

  *) Now possible for a customer to use a gift certificate and a promotion code at the same time.

  *) Added new Struts Validator to the storefront application to avoid XSS injection during 
     the submission of forms.
  
  *) Added a drop list and upload button to the customer communications panel of the Admin App
     to allow you to select templates and upload new ones. The templates are now stored in 
     a different directory for each store in a multi store environment.
  
  *) Modified the Edit Product panel in the Admin App to make it easier and more intuitive
     to upload images. Also added upload button for digital downloads.
   
  *) Improved I18N for the Admin App to allow decimal numbers such as prices to be inserted 
     using other characters as a decimal point. i.e. a comma.

  *) Added order number to the returns panel of the admin app to allow you to search for 
     returns based on the order number and not just the order id.
  
  *) Added a config variable in order to automatically enable a product when its quantity
     is changed to a value greater than 0 through the admin app API.

  *) OrderTotal modules can now obtain a list of the order total modules that have already
     been called.  

  *) Upgraded to version 1.4 of Solr.

  *) Invoices can now be created in PDF format and can also be attached to order confirmation 
     emails.  Invoices can also be viewed from both the storefront application and the Admin App.

  *) Added search rules for searching for products and other objects through the application
     and admin app APIs. The rules allow you to easily define whether and where, wild cards should
     be added. The admin app has a new properties file where default wild card settings can be 
     defined for the various panels within the admin app. 

  *) A new mode of operation is available for the Edit Customer panel of the Admin App to 
     allow you to define that certain roles may edit only "external" customer details.  This 
     is useful for the cases where customers are actually managed outside of KonaKart.  It
     makes it possible for the Admin User to edit only the Customer Group, the Newsletter
     subscription, the state (enabled/disabled) and the customer type (admin/customer/default).
 
  *) Added a config variable that controls whether customer Ids are displayed on the edit
     customer panel.  Customer Ids are now shown as floatover text on the Customers Panel. 

  *) New Netpay International payment gateway module added.

  *) New eWay Australia payment gateway module added.
  
  *) Product importer/exporter modified to import and export using UTF-8 encoding.
  
  *) Improvements to the installer - automatic discovery of current java environment improved
     and extra validation to check the selected java runtime environment is valid.
  
 
Bug Fixes-Admin App
------------------- 

  *) Links on the right hand side of the status page weren't working.
  
  *) edit review and delete review links on Edit Product panel weren't working

 
Bug Fixes-App
-------------

  *) Added a timestamp to paging links to avoid paging expired result sets that may be 
     accessed by using the browser back button.
  
  *) Fixed a bug when searching for products using Solr. Products under multiple categories
     being searched for "by category" were not being found.
   
  *) Latest products, random specials and random new products were not being translated when
     the language was changed.
  

Backwards Compatibility Alert
-----------------------------
   
  *) The velocity templates are no longer stored directly under the WEB-INF/classes
     directory. They are now stored under the installation home directory in a 
     the /templates/store_id/ directory structure where store_id is the id of the 
     store and defaults to store1 in a single store environment.   It is possible to 
     move these to any other location so long as you update the TEMPLATE_BASE_DIRECTORY
     to point at the new location.
 

  *) In addition to moving the velocity templates, they are all (those from the 
     konakart and konakartadmin webapps) now grouped together in the same location.   
     This resulted in a conflict of names where the EmailNewPassword_en.vm existed 
     in both the konakart and the konakartadmin webapps.   Therefore the one from 
     konakartadmin has been renamed to be EmailNewPasswordAdmin_en.


Changes with KonaKart 4.2.0.0 - Released 11-Jan-2010
====================================================

New Features
------------
  
  *) The store front application has been re-worked to give it a more modern look and
     feel including multiple images per product. The icons of the Admin App have also 
     been replaced to give a fresher look.

  *) Internationalization – The language of the admin app may now be changed dynamically.

  *) The Enterprise version of KonaKart now contains sophisticated marketing functionality
     that allows you to capture customer data as the customer uses your KonaKart
     eCommerce store; and to use that data within complex expressions in order to show
     dynamic content, activate promotions and send eMail communications.

  *) Gift Certificates are now supported. Gift Certificate products may be connected 
     to any type of promotion and activated through a coupon code contained within the 
     certificate.
 
  *) New functionality to allow digital download products (.txt and .pdf) to be indexed
     in the SOLR search engine so that they may be found by doing a product search using
     search keywords.
  
  *) New snippet functionality that returns text fragments surrounding search keywords
     so that the context of the search result can be determined. Useful especially
     for indexed digital download documents.

  *) The Enterprise version of KonaKart allows products to have an unlimited number of prices
     based on a product catalog id.
  
  *) A KonaKart product now has an average rating attribute that can be used in a search
     filter and to order the products returned. A batch job is supplied to set the average 
     rating based on all of the reviews present for a product. 

  *) Added dateAvailable to the search constraints for products.
  
  *) Tag and Tag Group Maintenance has been moved to the Products section of the Admin App. 
     Also a new Marketing section has been added.
  
  *) Custom Validation enhanced for the Admin App to include a wider selection of attributes.

     address from an external system.
  
  *) Ability to specify whether or not to use wildcard flags and a LIKE or EQUALS search 
     when searching for customers based on their email address (Admin API).
 
  *) Module parameters can now be masked from clear view (i.e. they show "******") in the 
     Admin App with the setting of "password" as the set_function in the configuration
     table.

  *) New MoneyBookers payment gateway module added (from a contribution by Chris Derham 
     of Atomus Ltd).
  
  *) The getSpecialsPerCategory() API call (app and admin app) has been given an extra 
     attribute to determine whether or not to search within sub categories. 
  
  *) The product search object has been given an extra attribute to configure whether
     the description should be returned for each product.
   
  *) The Velocity template engine can now be configured through an external properties file.

  *) Upgraded to Google GWT 1.7.
 
  
Bug Fixes-Admin App
------------------- 

  *) Mail subject is now encoded into UTF-8.

  *) Products in multiple categories are no longer deleted when deleting one of their
     categories. Also they are not moved to the parent category if they belong to another
     category.

  *) Upload of product images in Shared Customers mode wasn't working properly.
  
  *) Bug fixed in updateConfigurationGroup Admin API call where booleans were not handled
     correctly (this call was not actually used in KonaKart prior to 4.2.0.0).
 
 
Bug Fixes-App
-------------

  *) Mail subject is now encoded into UTF-8.

  *) The HTML escaping of reviews (when being inserted) was escaping too 
     many characters, making the review un-readable from the admin app. Now only the 
     standard HTML control characters are being escaped (i.e. <, >, &, ", ').
  
  *) Modified a divide operation in the saveOrder method call to avoid an exception during
     the customization of KonaKart if order prices were being modified without specifying
     the scale.

  *) The category tile was sometimes showing the incorrect category when viewing the details
     of a product that belongs to multiple categories.

  *) When showing products belonging directly to a parent category that has also sub 
     categories, the manufacturer drop list selector was showing the manufacturers
     of the products in the sub categories and not those of the products in the
     parent category.

  *) The manufacturer filter drop list was not being reset when transitioning from 
     viewing a category with products that have multiple manufacturers, to a category
     that has no products.
 
  *) Validation added to check for valid Country Ids when adding an address to a customer

  *) Coupon codes are now stored in the session so only have to be entered once.

  *) Secret key generation for asynchronous payment modules now works for load balanced
     systems.
  
  *) The quantity of a bundled product was not being calculated correctly.

  
Bug Fixes / Enhancements - Importer / Exporter 
----------------------------------------------

  *) Custom Validation settings defined for the Admin App are also used during imports.
  
  *) Improved support for the loading of larger data sets.
  
  *) Improved matching of records to avoid import of duplicate records.
  
  *) Support added for import and export of WishLists and WishList Items.
  
  *) Support added for all newly-added entities supported in XML_IO utility (including
     Customer Tags, Expressions etc).

  *) Bug fixed in the import of ConfigurationGroups - it was creating duplicates.


Backwards Compatibility Alert
-----------------------------
   
  *) The application and admin application method getSpecialsPerCategory()
     has been given an extra attribute in order to search or not search
     within sub categories.

  *) The PaymentInfo object no longer contains a Secret Key attribute. The
     method to generate a secret key is now called directly from the payment
     module when required.

 
Changes with KonaKart 4.1.0.0 - Released 28-Aug-2009
====================================================

New Features
------------
  
  *) Added shared products mode to multi-store. This feature allows you to add a product
     to multiple stores but only have to manage one copy of the product in the admin app.
     The product price may differ between the stores.
  
  *) KonaKart now supports Gift Registries. An implementation for wedding lists has been added 
     to the store front appplication.

  *) All client side exceptions shown to the customer are now also logged. 
  
  *) New API call to retrieve Categories to Tag Groups.
  
  *) Save button enabled in Admin App without the need to tab off fields. Improves 
     consistency of behaviour across all panels of the Admin App.

  *) Added USPS and USPS International payment gateways

  *) Various improvements to the XML Import/Export feature providing greater flexibility in 
     defining which objects to import/export (Enterprise Extensions only).
     Additional command line arguments have been made available with some example scripts to
     demonstrate the new features.
  
Bug Fixes-Admin App
-------------------  

  *) Fixed Calendar widget so that it expands to 6 rows where required.

  *) A number of minor bugs fixed where search filters and back buttons were being lost under 
     certain conditions.

Bug Fixes-App
-------------

  *) Fixed a bug where breadcrumbs were never resetting. It could be reproduced by clicking
     the add address button in the My Accounts section and then the back button.

  *) The assignment of zones to payment and shipping gateways was not working properly. The
     defined zone was not being detected. Now for example, you may want to assign a USA zone
     to the USPS gateway so that it doesn't get called for non US destinations.

  
Changes with KonaKart 4.0.0.0 - Released 05-Jun-2009
====================================================

New Features
------------
  
  *) Upgraded to Axis 1.4

  *) 3 custom fields added to zones table
  
  *) Support for multi-currency. A customer can now view and search for products 
     in a currency different to the default currency.

  *) Added cookie management to remember guests and their cart contents even if they haven't registered.
  
  *) Added many extra Application API calls that include an extra "options object". The purpose of this
     object is to pass the catalog id to the eCommerce engine so that the product manager may be specialized 
     to retrieve the product price and quantity from an external source based on the catalog id.
  
  *) Enhanced product select dialogs in Admin App. Can now include extra attributes based on a template
     and can search by SKU as well as by a keyword.
   
  *) Added an API call to the Admin App called setProductQuantity() and getProductQuantity() to change 
     the quantity of a product without having to retrieve the product, edit it and save it. A panel has
     also been added to enable power users to perform this action efficiently.
    
  *) Added custom fields to the session table.

  *) Two new API calls, addCustomDataToSession() and getCustomDataFromSession() have been added to the Admin
     App and Application APIs.

  *) Added the ability to retrieve customers using custom fields as search criteria.

  *) Added a Date Available attribute to the Products_quantity table so that each product variation
     can have a different available date.

  *) Added an API call to the Admin App called setProductAvailability() and getProductAvailability() to change 
     the available date of a product without having to retrieve the product, edit it and save it. A panel has
     also been added to enable power users to perform this action efficiently.

  *) Added the last modified date to an Admin Product. The creation and last modified dates are now visible 
     from the Admin App.
  
  *) For digital download products, added a Max Number of Downloads attribute and a
     Max Number of Download days attribute. If set, these values override the global values
     set using configuration variables.

  *) Added a Stock Reorder Level attribute to each product object. If set, this value overrides
     the global value set using a configuration variable.

  *) Custom Validation enhanced for the Admin App to include a wider selection of attributes

  *) Added an order tracking attribute to the order object. Added extra callouts to the 
     OrderIntegrationMgr to edit the order before it is saved and a specific one to add
     the tracking order before the order is saved.
  
  *) Added a "Can Order When Not In Stock" attribute to each product. If set, these values override 
     the global values set using configuration variables.
  
  *) Added an invisible attribute to categories so that they do not appear in the application when 
     invisible.
  
  *) Added SKU attribute to Basket and OrderProduct objects.

  *) Added State attribute to OrderProduct that defines the availability state of the product when the order 
     is created.

  *) Scheduling feature added (Enterprise Extensions only) using Quartz.  Includes three batch jobs: 
     RemoveExpiredCustomers, UnpaidOrderNotification and ProductAvailabilityNotification.

  *) Added the ability to clone stores in a multi-store configuration (Enterprise Extensions only) 
  
  *) New BIRT report - ProductsToReorder.
  
  *) Added support to integrate the KonaKart Admin App into Liferay.
  

Bug Fixes-Admin App
-------------------
    
  *) Sorting by "Logons" and "Last Logon" gives an error with Oracle.
   
  *) Non registered customers are no longer displayed in the customers section. These are 
     created when KonaKart is configured to allow checkout without registration; and were 
     being inadvertently displayed in the customer list. A parameter has been added to the 
     AdminCustomerSearch object in order to programmably display or not display the non 
     registered customers.
  
  *) The printing of the order invoice and packing slip wasn't working. 

  *) Fix to the SQL generated to set correct URL values for the default chart on the 
     status page of the Admin App.  (Only a problem on Linux with DB2, Oracle and MSSQL)

  *) Fix to the SQL generated to remove quotes around floating point values in currency 
     inserts.  (Only a problem with Oracle databases that do not convert strings such 
     as '1.306' to floats correctly).

  *) Corrections to two BIRT reports (only a problem under Oracle, DB2 and MS SQL).
     TopCustomers.rptdesign and TopProductsList.rptdesign.

  *) Fix to admin app to display prices when comma is selected as the decimal point.

  *) Customer type search attribute not working in getCustomers() and getCustomersLite() API calls.

 
Bug Fixes-App
-------------

  *) Changed the message catalog to remove the text : I am a returning customer. If you have already 
     shopped at our store but never registered, please click on the Password Forgotten link below 
     and we'll send you a password. A non registered customer needs to go through the registration process
     so the text is wrong.

  *) getCurrencies() API call was not using search criteria correctly.


Bug Fixes Google Base Interface 
-------------------------------

  *) Update required due to a change in the Googe Base API.
     This fixes the "You must specify an id for an item" error message.


Backwards Compatibility Alert
-----------------------------
   
  *) The application API call getProductQuantity(String encodedProductId) now returns a 
     ProductQuantityIf object rather than an int. The reason is to return the Date Available as 
     well as the quantity.

     This fixes the "You must specify an id for an item" error message.


Changes with KonaKart 3.2.0.0 - Released 01-Feb-2009
====================================================

New Features
------------
  
  *) Upgraded to BIRT 2.3.1

  *) Addition of Wish List functionality to engine and application.

  *) Addition of an Order Number attribute to the order object. This number may be set by 
     custom business logic when the order is saved.

  *) In multi-store single db mode, product searches can be performed across stores, providing 
     shopping mall functionality.

  *) In multi-store single db mode, custom functionality can be executed when new stores are
     added to a mall, or store definitions are updated.  (The default class for this hook is
     com.konakartadmin.bl.AdminStoreIntegrationMgr).
  
  *) The KonaKart role object now has 5 custom fields.

  *) Upgraded to Google GWT 1.5.3

  *) Added visual aid to tabs of insert / edit product panel to make it easier to identify
     what data is missing or doesn't validate.


Bug Fixes-Admin App
-------------------
    
  *) Prevent users from running reports from the Admin App once their session has expired.
     Previously no check was made to check to see if the session had expired before 
     reports were executed.  Now, if the session has expired when the Admin App user 
     attempts to run a report, he is logged out automatically.

  *) The method getOrderForOrderId() was not populating the formattedTotalIncTax attribute. 

  *) Put in a retry when creating sessions to avoid login failing due to duplicate sessions.


Bug Fixes-App
-------------

  *) Fixed a bug when creating the encoded product id for a basket item. 
     The id used to depend on the order of the options which could have caused a problem 
     if the same item with similar options was added twice but with a different ordering 
     of the options in the opts array.The system wouldn't have recognised it as 
     being the same item.

  *) Deletion of product attributes was causing null pointer errors when doing repeat orders 
     and for products that had already been added to the basket.

  *) Put in a retry when creating sessions to avoid login failing due to duplicate sessions.

  *) Fixed some reflected XSS vulnerabilities.
   
  *) Fixed caching problem for random product tiles. The price with tax wasn't getting updated when 
     a user from another tax area (different to the store tax area) logged in. The problem was
     only visible when KonaKart was configured to display prices including tax.
  
  *) Product belonging to more than one category was showing up multiple times in the best-seller
     list. One time for every category.


Backwards Compatibility Alert
-----------------------------
   
  *) SetConfigurationValue in the Admin API has changed.   This now requires an extra parameter.
     The extra parameter is the session Id.  This has been modified to ensure that changes
     to configuration values are only made by callers with a valie sessionId.  (SessionIds are
     returned from successful logins).   


Changes with KonaKart 3.0.1.0 - Released 07-Oct-2008
====================================================

New Features
------------
  
  *) Multistore. One instance of KonaKart can now manage multiple stores.

  *) Fully indexed search using the Jakarta Lucene search engine. As well as being very fast regardless of the size
     of your catalog; it caters for misspellings, synonyms, plurals and alternate spellings.
  
  *) New payment modules Elink and BluePay

  *) New FedEx shipping module.

  *) Google Analytics Integration.  (See User Guide for details on how to configure this feature)

  *) Added new eMail API calls to application and deprecated the old ones. The new API calls have the following advantages:
        - They allow you to add an array of name / value pair objects in order to pass custom data to 
          the Velocity templates
        - They allow you to choose a template name. In the case of the OrderConfirmation eMail, 
          three different templates are now used for when the order is received, when payment is received 
          and for when the payment transaction is not successful.
        - More standard data such as a fully populated customer object has been added to the VelocityContext.
        - In all cases, the eMail subject is now read from the first line of the template.

  *) Added new eMail API calls to the Admin App to allow the addition of an array of name / value pair objects 
     in order to pass custom data to the Velocity templates.

  *) Added ability to save credit card details in an encrypted format. The details can be edited from the Admin App.

  *) New configuration flag for the Admin App to enable or disable the initial search that is performed on the 
     Customers Panel.

  *) New configuration flag for the Admin App to control the behaviour of the clear button on the Customers Panel.  If set 
     to true the clear button will clear both the search criteria AND any current results;  if set to false, the clear 
     button clears only the search criteria.   It is expected that most users will leave this at the default value which is
     false.

  *) KonaKart is now bundled with Apache Tomcat 6.0.18

  *) The order of product attributes displayed in the application can now be controlled and is identical to the order
     set in the Admin app when they are created.

  *) Google Base Integration.   Allows you to publish your products in Google Base.


Bug Fixes-App
-------------

  *) Some labels in the application were not getting translated properly into the new language when a language was changed.
     The labels in question are all of those set from ActionClasses and not those set in the JSPs (mainly the breadcrumbs). 

  *) The Category tile was not getting translated into the new language after a language change, until it was clicked on.

  *) If all categories had the last_modified date set to null, the server side caching wasn't working correctly. It would 
     always re-calculate the category tree. 
   
  *) Digital download records weren't being deleted when a product was deleted. Also digital downloads were being returned
     by the Application API call even if the product had been deleted.

  *) Code has been added to not call a payment gateway if the total of the order is zero.

  *) The behaviour of checkout without registration has been modified to prevent privacy issues. If a registered user attempts 
     to checkout without logging in, the system detects that the eMail address already belongs to a registered user and so 
     asks for his password  rather than proceeding to checkout and overwriting data belonging to the registered user.
  
  *) The URLs generated when selecting products for a category or for a manufacturer could not be copy and pasted into a 
     new browser to produce the same output.
 
  *) In the most detailed Auditing Mode, when running with DB2 or Oracle, the object_to_string column was insufficient to
     hold the highest level of detail.  In 3.0.1.0 the object_to_string column as been altered (for DB2 and Oracle) to hold 
     all auditing data.

  *) Removed unused javascript from LoginBody.jsp

  *) If directly after viewing a category with tags, you switched to one with no products, the tags of the previous category 
     were being shown.


Bug Fixes Importer / Exporter 
-----------------------------

  *)  Invisible products weren't importing or exporting properly       

Bug Fixes One-Page-Checkout GWT Dev Kit 
---------------------------------------

  *)  Missing loader.gif added to development kit.  
     

Bug Fixes Portlets 
------------------

  *)  redirect=true has been added to a number of forward statements in struts-config.xml. This fixes a bug which didn't
      allow the browser back button to be used in all cases. Sometimes it would navigate back to an empty portal. 
 
  *)  <action path="/ShowProductsForManufacturer"/> has been added to struts-portlet-config.xml to fix a bug where the
      link to "other products" from the manufacturer tile wasn't working. 

  *)  Fixed product links on EditCartBody.jsp. These links were using the struts nested tag and weren't getting translated
      by the portal bridge. They have been changed to use the struts html tag.



Backwards Compatibility Alert
-----------------------------
   
  *) KonaKart engines have new constructors to cater for multistore. In some cases the old constructors have been deprecated.



Changes with KonaKart 2.2.6.0 - Released 28-May-2008
====================================================

New Features
------------

  *) Added support for bundles. Bundle products can be defined in the Admin App. The quantity of the bundle product 
     is calculated automatically and tools are provided to calculate the cost (optionally using discounts) and the weight.
     In the application, the bundled products are available in the product detail screen, the quantity available is
     calculated and the quantity in stock of the bundled products is decremented automatically when an order is processed.

  *) Added product tags and tag groups to enable detailed product searches based on the tags. Tag groups can be linked
     to a category in order to display them in a context sensitive manner. i.e. You could link a "Food Type" tag group to
     a restaurant category in order to select only restaurants that serve vegetarian dishes or spicy food etc.

  *) Added an application feature whereby any previous order can be repeated with a single click.

  *) New application feature to see shipping costs and promotions on cart details page without needing to
     register or log in.
  
  *) New application feature to log in automatically after registration.

  *) New customization framework for modifying / supplementing the KonaKart engine behavior.  This provides 
     hooks that are easy to program that allow you to customize the KonaKart engines. See ENGINE CUSTOMIZATION FAQ
     for more details.

  *) Two new API calls on both the Application API and the Admin App API:
         String custom(String input1, String input2)
         String customSecure(String sessionId, String input1, String input2)
     These allow you to add your own engine interfaces to enhance the behavior of the KonaKart engines.
     See ENGINE CUSTOMIZATION FAQ for more details.

  *) Added 10 custom panels that display a predefined URL in a frame. This feature allows you to extend the 
     Admin App by adding your own administration functionality outside the standard Admin App. 

  *) Added the ability to program a button on the Admin App Returns Panel to call your own custom URL. 
     An example of its use could be to call an application that processes credit card refunds through the 
     payment gateway.
 
  *) When AdminOrderProducts are returned by the Admin API they now have the optionId and valueId attributes of 
     the options populated, and not just the name and value.

  *) UTF-8 encoding now used for the mail sent out from the Email command in the Admin App allowing double-byte
     characters to be used in customer emails.

  *) The product search functionality in the Admin App has been enhanced.
  
  *) Added new method addToBasketWithOptions(). Currently there is one option that allows you force a product
     into a new basket item even if an identical product already exists. The default behaviour is to just update
     the quantity of the existing item.

  *) Added new method createOrderWithOptions(). Currently there are two options: One allows you to automatically copy 
     all of the basket custom fields to the orderProduct custom fields which are generated from the basket items. 
     The other allows you to use the default customer to generate a temporary order for customers that haven't registered 
     or logged in. The order totals from the temporary order are used to display shipping costs and promotions on the
     cart details page.
  
  *) Added custom fields to cartItem.

  *) In the Admin App added a button to select the customer from the orders panel.

  *) KonaKart version number and build date has added to the meta data in the Admin App (KonakartAdmin.html file) - this
     provides a convenient way to find out which version you are running.


Bug Fixes-App
-------------
  
  *) Fixed bug to clear the order history list when a customer logs out.
   
  *) Fixed array out of bounds exception when there were no categories in the system.
  
  *) getShippingQuote() was throwing a null pointer exception if the shipping module didn’t exist.

  *) getPaymentDetails() was throwing a null pointer exception if the payment module didn’t exist.
  
  *) UpdateBasket was not updating the custom fields.

  *) When the session was timing out, the user was receiving an exception in the application.


Backwards Compatibility Alert
-----------------------------

  *) Previously there were two Application API calls called "getPaymentDetails" (they were overloaded with different
     parameters).   We have changed the name of one of these calls to getPaymentDetailsPerOrder to avoid having any 
     overloading in the APIs.   Therefore, if you used...
         
         public PaymentDetailsIf getPaymentDetails(String sessionId, String moduleCode,
            OrderIf order, String hostAndPort, int languageId) throws KKException;

     ... you should change the name of the call to getPaymentDetailsPerOrder()


Changes with KonaKart 2.2.5.0 - Released 01-Apr-2008
====================================================

New Features
------------

  *) Provided more flexible customer search options in new droplists on the Admin App Customer Panel.  
     These can also be disabled by using role-based security settings.
  
  *) Added the ability to program a button on the Admin App Customer Panel to call your own custom URL. 
     This button will not be visible unless you define the label to be non-empty in the Admin App Configuration 
     Panel.


Bug Fixes-Admin App
-------------------
  
  *) If the Customer Panel is the one and only panel authorised for a user, it sometimes failed at start-up due 
     to a race condition.  
  

Backwards Compatibility Alert
-----------------------------

  *) The database upgrade script sets customers' customers_type to 0 where the customers_type is null.  This indicates
     that the customer is a normal customer more explicitly.


Changes with KonaKart 2.2.4.0 - Released 13-Mar-2008
====================================================

New Features
------------

  *) Added a new API call to com.konakart.al.ProductMgr to allow you to set the default order_by
     for API calls that retrieve arrays of products. Previously the default was set to 
     "Order by price ascending" and not configurable.
  
  *) Added EditOrder(), a new API call for the Admin API. It allows you to edit some order attributes.

  *) Enriched the functionality of the Admin API call, getOrders(), to allow you to search by Custom fields, 
     Date Added and Date Finished.
  
  *) In the Admin App when uploading an image, the directory will now be created if it doesn't already exist.

  *) Added a hook to allow custom credential checking during Login. This allows a company implementing KonaKart to 
     develop their own credential checking algorithms rather than to use the standard KonaKart implementation.
     It can also be used to achieve Single Sign On and to connect to an LDAP directory.
  
  *) Added a new API call to the AdminEng to return the top level categories.

  *) Added configuration variables to specify whether you want a wildcard ('%') placed before or after text
     that is entered for searches in the Admin App.   The default will be the pre-2.2.4.0 behaviour of adding
     wildcard search characters before and after all eneterd search text.

  *) Included "Packing List" and "Invoice" buttons as part of the role-based security system - allows you to 
     enable or disable these buttons in role definitions.   The default setting is pre-2.2.4.0 behaviour which is 
     to enable both buttons.


Bug Fixes-Admin App
-------------------
  
  *) The lastModified attribute of an order was not being updated when the status of the order was 
     changed through the Admin API.
  
  *) The back button from the edit product panel wasn't always working after uploading an image.

  *) The getCustomers() API call wasn't instantiating the last modified date for the customer objects.

  *) Unable to control the visibility of the Reset Password button on the Customers Window.


Bug Fixes-App
-------------

  *) Fixed bug to allow the DataDescriptor to be set to null for most API calls that retrieve products and reviews.
     The Javadoc was already reporting this behaviour although the engine was throwing an exception when
     finding a null value.


Changes with KonaKart 2.2.3.0 - Released 12-Feb-2008
====================================================

New Features
------------

  *) Added a new product type : "physical product with free shipping". This allows you to set 
     free shipping on a product by product basis in the Admin App. There is also a new Shipping 
     Module called FreeProduct which needs to be installed. This module will return a shipping quote
     of zero if it detects that the physical products within the order all have free shipping.
  
  *) Added user configurable length checking for certain product attributes entered through the Admin App.

  *) Added customer groups. These can be maintained through the Admin App. Customers may be associated 
     to any one customer group. i.e. Wholesale / Retail customers.

  *) When the customer group of a customer is changed through the Admin App, a template based eMail 
     may automatically be sent to the customer. This is a useful feature for the case where a customer
     is in a temporary group waiting for approval. i.e. A customer may sign up as a wholesale customer 
     but needs to be approved by an Admin person. The approval /denial process involves moving the customer
     to the wholesale or retail group. A different template may be picked up depending on which group 
     the customer is moved to.

  *) Added multiple prices for product. The product object (and product attributes) has an extra 3 price
     fields to store alternative prices such as wholesale price and MRP. The priceId attribute of the 
     customer group determines which prices are used for any one customer. This enables you to display
     different prices to different customers depending on which customer group they belong to.

  *) Added a new engine API call to enable you to send any template based eMail to a customer.

  *) Added extra features to the Customers panel in the Admin App:
     - You can now search for customers by street, city, postcode and customer group as well as by name
       type and enabled / disabled.
     - You can display the address of the customer through a configurable template that controls what address
       fields are displayed and the formatting of these fields.

  *) Added functionality in Admin App to select a customer and open up a new browser window displaying the
     KonaKart eCommerce application, automatically logging in the selected customer. This is a useful feature 
     for call center users who may need to accept telephone orders. It allows them to log in on behalf of a customer 
     without requiring the customer's credentials and to perform any transaction that the customer could normally
     perform.


  *) Added a dynamic gif to indicate that GWT code is loading. It appears in the checkout section of the application
